Such regulations shall exempt any packaged commodity whose net weight is one whole unit or two whole units and which has the retail price plainly marked thereon. No packaged commodity shall be included in these regulations which must be individually marked with the cost per unit of weight, liquid, or dry measure, as provided in section one hundred and eighty-one of chapter ninety-four. Said director of standards may adopt such further regulations as are necessary to carry out the intent of this section, provided that a public hearing shall be held relative to any packaged commodity proposed to be regulated.

When multiple loaves are baked, each unit of the loaf shall conform to the weight required by this section. The weights herein specified shall mean net weights not more than twelve hours after baking, or not more than twelve hours after the sale and delivery of such loaves by the manufacturer or by his servant or agent. Such weights shall be determined by the average weight of not less than six loaves; provided, that such average weight shall be determined by the weight of at least twelve loaves whenever such number of loaves is available at the time and place of such weighing; and provided further, that bread found upon any premises occupied for the manufacture of bread for sale, or any bread found in the wagons, trucks, baskets, boxes, or other delivery vehicles or receptacles owned or controlled by the manufacturer of such bread, and being transported or delivered for sale, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to have been baked within twelve hours unless such bread is marked, designated or segregated as stale bread, under regulations prescribed by the director of standards.

When an inspection of bread is made at any bakery by the director or any inspector of standards or sealer of weights and measures, the manufacturer of such bread, or his servants or agents, shall, upon request of the official making such inspection, inform him whether such bread is manufactured for sale in any of the standard unit weights prescribed by the preceding section and, if not so manufactured for sale in such standard unit weights, shall furnish such official with samples of the labels or wrappers intended to be used on all such loaves of other than standard unit weights

Section 9. The director of standards shall prescribe such rules and regulations as are necessary to enforce the two preceding sections, including reasonable tolerances or variations within which all weights shall be kept; provided, that such tolerances or variations shall not exceed one ounce per pound under the standard unit or marked weight.

(e) Food stores or food departments utilizing an individual item pricing system shall be allowed to exempt additional items, the exact number of which shall be based on the number of operable cash registers located at the main checkout location. Food stores or food departments with 1 operable cash register shall be allowed to exempt 20 additional items. Food stores or food departments with 2, 3 to 4 or 5 to 6 operable cash registers shall be allowed to exempt 50, 100 or 200 additional items, respectively.

All additional exemptions allowed under this subsection shall be granted provided that the food store or food department maintains an automated checkout system that has been determined to be at least 95 per cent accurate during a price accuracy inspection conducted by the division or a designee and maintains a dated, written price list of the items it has chosen to exempt.

[Subsection (i) as amended by 2017, 110, Sec. 11 effective November 3, 2017.]
(i) Notwithstanding subsection (g) of section 184D, if there is a discrepancy between the advertised price, the sticker price, the scanner price or the display price and the checkout price on any grocery item, a food store or a food department shall charge a consumer the lowest price.

For the purposes of this subsection and unless the deputy director determines otherwise, individual items that differ only by color, flavor or scent shall be counted as the same item if they are identical in all other aspects, including price, brand, and may only vary in random weight. This subsection shall not apply if: (1) there is evidence of willful tampering; or (2) the discrepancy is a gross error, in that the lowest price is less than half of the checkout price and the seller, in the previous 30 days, did not intend to sell the grocery item at the lowest price. The provisions of this subsection shall be clearly and conspicuously posted by all food stores or food departments which use a consumer price scanner system at each register. For each register that fails to display appropriate signage, the food store or food department shall be subject to a fine of $200, up to a maximum of $500 per inspection by the deputy director. All food stores or food departments shall maintain data on price discrepancies. This data shall be provided to the division upon request. 
(k) The deputy director may require sellers to disclose a consumer's rights under sections 184C to 184E, inclusive, by a writing provided by the division.
(l) The division shall promulgate regulations for the administration and enforcement of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, may constitute a violation under chapter 93A.

Section 184D: Inspection of food stores and food departments for compliance with Secs. 184B to 184E; violations and fines; consumer complaint of noncompliance

Section 184D. (a) The deputy director or the deputy director's inspectors and sealers of weights and measures and those deputies, as defined in section 1 of chapter 98, shall inspect each food store or food department for compliance with sections 184B to 184E, inclusive. The inspections shall be conducted pursuant to the national industry standards adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures of the National Institute of Standards and Technology or any other rules or guidelines promulgated by the division pertaining to the implementation and enforcement of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive. Nothing shall inhibit the oversampling of sale items during inspections. A food store or food department shall provide the inspector with access necessary to conduct an inspection. The deputy director shall notify the food store or food department in writing of violations of this section and of any fines imposed pursuant to sections 184B to 184E, inclusive.
(b) Violations of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, for which fines shall be levied shall include, but not be limited to: (1) having no price marked on a unit that is required to be priced and is not exempted; (2) having an incorrect price on a unit; (3) having an incorrect or missing sign; or (4) overcharging on a unit. A unit shall be deemed to be overcharged once it is rung up at a price higher than any represented price. Notwithstanding the method for determining the amount of civil fines under section 29A of chapter 98, a civil citation may be issued for $200 for each violation, up to a maximum of $5,000 per inspection, for a food store or a food department utilizing a consumer price scanner system. Notwithstanding the method for determining the amount of civil fines under said section 29A of said chapter 98, a civil citation may be issued for $100 per violation, up to a maximum of $2,500 per inspection, for a food store or food department utilizing an individual item pricing system. For a food store or a food department utilizing a consumer price scanner system, if an item is advertised either in a food store, food department or in a circular as on sale or discounted because of a loyalty card price and the item registers at a higher price at the checkout counter than indicated by a sale or loyalty card price, a civil citation shall be issued for $300 per violation, up to a maximum of $5,000 per inspection. The deputy director shall not issue a fine under sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, and section 56D of chapter 98 for the same violation.
(c) A fine imposed by the deputy director shall be paid within 21 days of issuance of the notice, unless the seller appeals pursuant to the civil citation appeal process found in section 29A of chapter 98. The food store or food department shall immediately correct any noncompliance with sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, when notified by the inspector.
(d) The deputy director or any representative authorized by the division may conduct inspections of any item and shall issue notices of violation to any food store or food department for any violation of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive; provided, however, that no food store or food department shall be inspected more than once a month, unless such inspection is intended to verify the correction of violations found during a recent inspection or to verify the validity of a specific consumer complaint made through the process in subsection (e). For the purposes of this section, each occasion that an item scans erroneously during an inspector's attempt to verify its correct price shall constitute a separate civil violation. The seller shall immediately correct all violations.
(e) A consumer may submit a complaint to the attorney general or to the deputy director regarding noncompliance with sections 184B to 184E, inclusive. All food stores or food departments subject to sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, shall provide, upon request, a complaint form for the consumer to complete and submit. Each submitted complaint shall be investigated. In the case of any verified consumer complaint, fines for overcharging shall be limited to 1 violation per item. A fine shall be issued upon verification of any consumer complaint alleging overcharging or improper price marking.
(f) If the deputy director determines that a food store or a food department is either intentionally or through gross negligence violating any provisions of sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, the deputy director shall provide written notice of such determination to the food store or food department and the food store or food department shall have 30 days to cure these violations. If upon re-inspection, the deputy director determines that the food store or food department still is not in substantial compliance with this section and sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, all of the food store's or food department's exemptions shall be rescinded for a period of 12 months and the matter shall be referred to the attorney general for action against that food store or food department.
(g) Sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, shall only apply to food stores and to grocery items in food departments. Said sections shall not diminish any obligations under other laws or regulations regarding item pricing for sellers other than food stores or for items other than grocery items in food departments. If a seller is also subject to the item pricing regulations or guidelines of another agency, in cases where a specified number of items is allowed to be exempted under 2 similar exceptions to the requirement of item pricing, such similar provisions shall not be additive. Compliance with another agency's regulations or guidelines which differ from said sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, or any regulations issued under those sections by the deputy director shall not be a defense to a violation of said sections or any regulations promulgated under said sections hereunder. 
(h) The division may retain all registration fees and fines it collects under sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, sections 56D and 56E of chapter 98 not to exceed $2,500,000 annually in order to support its enforcement activities; provided, however, that any excess fees and fines, up to $1,000,000 in excess of this figure, shall be used to fund the division of standards municipal grant program for approved agents to assist the division in lieu of a legislative appropriation. In the event that the division and the municipal grant program are fully funded, all additional revenue shall be turned over to the General Fund.

Section 184E: Conversion from individual item pricing system to consumer price scanner system operation and inspection of consumer price scanner system

Section 184E. (a) A food store or food department seeking to convert from an individual item pricing system to a consumer price scanner system shall seek a waiver from the division. The waiver shall be granted by the division provided that the food store or food department has no outstanding fines under sections 184B to 184D, inclusive, or section 56D of chapter 98 and pays a $250 fee annually to the division if the retail space is less than 15,000 square feet, $500 fee if the retail space is greater than or equal to 15,000 square feet, but less than 30,000 square feet or a $1,000 fee if the retail space is 30,000 square feet or more.
(b) Under the regulations promulgated under this chapter, the division shall require each applicant to complete a "no job loss" affidavit which shall include, but not be limited to, the number of people employed at the time of the application process and the establishment of a complaint process, to ensure that full and part-time employees do not suffer any wage or benefit loss due to the transfer. After the filing of the affidavit, if there is any resulting job loss at the store due to the implementation of the waiver, as determined by the division, not attributed to seasonal employment or verifiable economic pressures, the store shall be required to use an individual item pricing system for 1 year under sections 184B to 184E, inclusive, or other applicable laws or regulations promulgated hereunder and be subject to a fine of not more than $5,000.
(c) A food store or food department using a consumer price scanner system shall be subject to inspection by the deputy director for compliance with this section. The deputy director shall not cause any food store or food department using a consumer price scanner system to be inspected more than once per calendar month. If, within the previous 30 days, there is a verified pattern of consumer complaints or, upon regular inspection, the food store or food department is not in compliance with this section, the division may inspect a food store or food department using a consumer scanner pricing system once every week until the food store or food department is found to be in compliance with this section.
(d) Each food store or food department with more than 5,000 square feet of retail space that employs a consumer price scanner system shall have at least 1 fully operational consumer price scanner for every 5,000 square feet of retail space or part thereof. The location of a consumer price scanner shall be disclosed by 1 clear and conspicuous sign at eye-level and 1 clear and conspicuous sign above eye level. Consumer price scanners shall be equally spaced throughout the store in fixed locations. A food store or food department with more than 5,000 square feet but less than 20,000 square feet shall have 1 fully operational consumer price scanner capable of producing an individual item pricing tag, located at the front of the food store or food department. A food store or food department with more than 20,000 square feet shall have 2 fully operational consumer price scanners capable of producing an individual item pricing tag, with at least 1 located at the front of the food store or food department. At all such scanner locations, the food store or food department shall provide the consumer with a means by which such pricing tag may be affixed or appended to the item or its packaging, such as tape or an adhesive price tag. The deputy director may, by regulation, authorize new technologies in lieu of required consumer price scanners which further the intent of this section, including, but not limited to, hand held or shopping cart attached scanners which retain in memory and itemize all scanned items. Such technologies may reduce the required number of consumer scanners by no more than 50 per cent. 
(e) Consumer price scanners shall be deemed fully operational if: (1) the consumer price scanner clearly and conspicuously identifies and displays the item by name or other distinguishing characteristics; and (2) the consumer price scanner displays the item's correct price when the item is scanned and, in the case of a food store or food department that uses loyalty cards or otherwise maintains a dual pricing system, the consumer price scanner displays both the loyalty card price and the non-card price if they differ. A sign containing contact information for the division shall be posted by each consumer price scanner so that consumers may report broken consumer price scanners. Such consumer price scanners shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, 28 CFR Part 36, Appendix A and the architectural access board regulations 521 CMR 1.00, et. seq. Any violation of this subsection shall be considered in determining a consumer price scanner's pass or fail designation as defined in subsection (i).
(f) Any food store or food department with more than 5,000 square feet of total space converting from an individual item pricing system to a consumer price scanner pricing system shall within 3 months of such conversion hire or maintain not less than 2 employees whose responsibilities shall include the maintenance of all consumer price scanners within the food store or food department.
(g) An inspector may choose to test a food store or food department's consumer price scanner system for accuracy. The inspector may choose the sample size for accuracy tests provided that the size of sample is not less than 50 items and not more than 200 items. Any scanning that yields an incorrect price that causes a food store or food department's consumer price scanner accuracy rating to fall below 98 per cent shall constitute a separate violation. This subsection shall not be used to impact a scanner's pass or fail grade as defined in subsection (i) but the cumulative violations of this subsection in any particular store or department shall be used in contributing toward the maximum fine imposed under the same subsection.
(h) Upon inspection, the deputy director shall notify the store manager, who shall provide the inspector with a map of the food store or food department outlining the consumer price scanner locations and the food store or food department's square footage of retail space. The food store or food department's number of scanners shall be sufficient for the food store or food department's size under subsection (d). Any violation of this subsection shall result in a fine of $1,000, which shall not count toward the maximum fine established under subsection (i); provided, however, that the deputy director may reduce this fine consistent with section 29A of chapter 98.
(i) Each consumer price scanner shall be graded on a pass or fail basis by inspectors. A failing consumer price scanner shall include, but not be limited to, missing consumer price scanners or inadequate signage under subsection (d). Each scanner found to have failed the test shall constitute a separate violation of this section. Notwithstanding the method for determining the amount of civil fines under section 29A of chapter 98, a civil fine may be issued for $200 for each violation, up to a maximum of $2,500 per inspection; provided, however, that the deputy director may reduce any fine imposed under this section consistent with said section 29A of said chapter 98.

An affidavit of the deputy director, or of any person authorized by him to send such copy, that such copy has been mailed shall be prima facie evidence thereof.

Service of such process shall be made by leaving duplicate copies thereof with a fee, as determined annually by the commissioner of administration under the provision of section three B of chapter seven, in the hands of the deputy director, or in his office, and the deputy director shall forthwith send one of said copies by mail, postage prepaid; addressed to the defendant at his last address as appearing on the deputy director's records; and an affidavit of the deputy director, or of any person authorized by him to send such copy, that such copy has been so mailed shall be prima facie evidence thereof. One of the duplicates of such process, certified by the deputy director as having been served upon him, shall be sufficient evidence of service upon him under said power of attorney.

202 CMR 3.00: 	MODEL STATE PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Section 3.01: Foreword
3.02: Application
3.03: Definitions 
3.04: Identity 
3.05: Declaration of Identity: Non-consumer Package 
3.06: Declaration of Responsibility: Consumer and Non-consumer Packages

3.01: Foreword 
	The Model State Packaging and Labeling Regulation was first adopted during the 37th National Conference on Weights and Measures in 1952. Reporting to the Conference, the Committee on Legislation stated:
	 The National Conference should adopt a model package regulation for the guidance of those States authorized to adopt such a regulation under provisions of their weights and measures laws. Since so much of the work of weights and measures officials in the package field concerns food products, the importance of uniformity between the Federal Food and Drug Administration's regulations and any model regulations to be adopted by this Conference cannot be overemphasized.
	 Since its inception, the Model Packaging Regulation has been continually revised to meet the complexities of an enormous expansion in the packaging industry--an expansion which, in late 1966, brought about the passage of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Recognizing the need for compatibility with the Federal Act, the Committee on Laws and Regulations of the 53rd National Conference in 1968 amended the Model Packaging and Labeling Regulation to parallel regulations adopted by Federal agencies under FPLA. The process of amending and revising this Regulation is a continuing one, in order to keep it current with practices in the packaging field and make it compatible with appropriate Federal Regulations.


 3.02: Application 
	202 CMR 3.00 shall apply to packages and to commodities in package form, but shall not apply to: 
(1) inner wrappings not intended to be individually sold to the customer, 
(2) shipping containers or wrapping used solely for the transportation of any commodities in bulk or in quantity to manufacturers, packers, or processors, or to wholesale or retail distributors, but in no event shall this exclusion apply to packages of consumer or Non-consumer commodities, as defined herein, 
(3) auxiliary containers or outer wrappings used to deliver packages of such commodities to retail customers if such containers or wrappings bear no printed matter pertaining to any particular commodity, 
(4) containers used for retail tray pack displays when the container itself is not intended to be sold (e.g., the tray that is used to display individual envelopes of seasonings, gravies, etc. and the tray itself is not intended to be sold), 
(5) commodities put up in variable weights and sizes for sale intact and intended to be either weighed or measured at the time of sale, where no package quantities are represented, and where the method of sale is clearly indicated in close proximity to the quantity being sold, or 
(6) open carriers and transparent wrappers or carriers for containers when the wrappers or carriers do not bear any written, printed, or graphic matter obscuring the label information required by 202 CMR 3.00. 
3.03: Definitions 
Commodity in Package Form. The term "commodity in package form" shall be construed to mean a commodity put up or packaged in any manner in advance of sale in units suitable for either wholesale or retail sale. An individual item or lot of any commodity not in package form as defined in this section, but on which there is marked a selling price based on an established price per unit of weight or of measure, shall be construed to be a commodity in package form. Where the term "package" is used in 202 CMR 3.00, it shall be construed to mean "commodity in package form" as herein defined. 
Consumer Package: Package of Consumer Commodity. A "consumer package" or "package of consumer commodity" shall be construed to mean a commodity in package form that is customarily produced or distributed for sale through retail sales agencies or instrumentalities for consumption by individuals, or use by individuals for the purposes of personal care or in the performance of services ordinarily rendered in or about the household or in connection with personal possessions. 
Label. The term "label" shall be construed to mean any written, printed, or graphic matter affixed to, applied to, attached to, blown into, formed, molded into, embossed on, or appearing upon or adjacent to a consumer commodity or a package containing any consumer commodity, for purposes of branding, identifying, or giving any information with respect to the commodity or to the contents of the package, except an inspector's tag or other non-promotional matter affixed to or appearing upon a consumer commodity shall not be deemed to be a label requiring the repetition of label information required by 202 CMR 3.00. 
Multi-Unit Package. The term "multi-unit package" shall be construed to mean a package containing two or more individual packages of the same commodity, in the same quantity, with the individual packages intended to be sold as part of the multi-unit package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of 202 CMR 3.00. 
Non-consumer Package: Package of Non-consumer Commodity. A "Non-consumer package" or "package of Non-consumer commodity" shall be construed to mean any commodity in package form other than a consumer package, and particularly a package intended solely for industrial or institutional use or for wholesale distribution. 
Person. The term "person" shall be construed to mean both singular and plural, and shall include any individual, partnership, company, corporation, association, and society.
Principal Display Panel or Panels. The term "principal display panel or panels" shall be construed to mean that part, or those parts, of a label that is, or are, so designed as to most likely be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal and customary conditions of display and purchase. Wherever a principal display panel appears more than once on a package, all requirements pertaining to the "principal display panel" shall pertain to all such "principal display panels." 
Random Package. The term "random package" shall be construed to mean a package that is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights; that is, packages of the same consumer commodity with no fixed pattern of weight.
3.04: Identity 
	(1) Declaration of Identity: Consumer Package. A declaration of identity on a consumer package shall appear on the principal display panel, and shall positively identify the commodity in the package by its common or usual name, description, generic term, or the like. 
	(2) Parallel Identity Declaration: Consumer Package. A declaration of identity on a consumer package shall appear generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed. 
3.05: Declaration of Identity: Non-consumer Package 
	A declaration of identity on a Non-consumer package shall appear on the outside of a package and shall positively identify the commodity in the package by its common or usual name, description, generic term, or the like. 
3.06: Declaration of Responsibility: Consumer and Non-consumer Packages 
	Any package kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold, at any place other than on the premises where packed shall specify conspicuously on the label of the package the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. The name shall be the actual corporate name, or, when not incorporated, the name under which the business is conducted. The address shall include street address, city, state, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be omitted if this is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply only to labels that have been developed or revised after July 1, 1968. 
	If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a commodity at a place other than his principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where the commodity was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading. Where the commodity is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such commodity, such as "Manufacture for and packed by________," "Distributed by_________ ," or any other wording of similar import that expresses the facts. 
3.07: Declaration of Quantity: Consumer Packages 
(1) Largest Whole Unit. Where 202 CMR 3.00 requires that the quantity declaration be in terms of the largest whole unit, the declaration shall, with respect to a particular package, be in terms of the largest whole unit of weight or measure, with any remainder expressed in 
	(a) common or decimal fractions of such largest whole unit, or in 
	(b) the next smaller whole unit, or units, with any further remainder in terms of common or 	   	      decimal fractions of the smallest unit present in the quantity declaration. 
(2) Net Quantity. A declaration of net quantity of the commodity in the package, exclusive of wrappers and any other material packed with such commodity, shall appear on the principal display panel of a consumer package, and, unless otherwise specified in 202 CMR 3.00 (see 202 CMR 3.07(8)), shall be in terms of the largest whole unit. 
	(a) Use of "Net Weight." The term "net weight" shall be used in conjunction with the declaration   	     of quantity in terms of weight; the term may either precede or follow the declaration of     		     weight. 
	(b) Lines of Print or Type. A declaration of quantity may appear on one or more lines of print or 	    	     type.
 (3) Terms: Weight, Liquid Measure, or Count. The declaration of the quantity of a particular commodity shall be expressed in terms of liquid measure if the commodity is liquid, or in terms of weight if the commodity is solid, semisolid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid, or in terms of numerical count. However, if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom with respect to the terms used in expressing a declaration of quantity of a particular commodity, such declaration of quantity may be expressed in its traditional terms, if such traditional declaration gives accurate and adequate information as to the quantity of the commodity. 
(4) Combination Declaration. 
	(a) A declaration of quantity in terms of weight shall be combined with appropriate declarations 	  	      of the measure, count, and size of the individual units unless a declaration of weight alone is 		      fully informative. 
	(b) A declaration of quantity in terms of measure shall be combined with appropriate 	  	  	      declarations of the weight, count, and size of the individual units unless a declaration of    		      measure alone is fully informative. 
	(c) A declaration of quantity in terms of count shall be combined with appropriate declarations 	   	     of the weight, measure, and size of the individual units unless a declaration of count alone is   	     fully informative. 
(5) Units: Weight, Measure. A declaration of quantity
(a) in units of weight shall be in terms of the avoirdupois pound or ounce; 
(b) in units of liquid measure shall be in terms of the United States gallon of 231 cubic inches or liquid-quart, liquid-pint, or fluid-ounce subdivisions of the gallon, and shall express the volume at 68°F (20°C), except in the case of petroleum products, for which the declaration shall express the volume at 60°F (15.6°C), and except also in the case of a commodity that is normally sold and consumed while frozen, for which the declaration shall express the volume at the frozen temperature, and except also in the case of a commodity that is normally sold in the refrigerated state, for which the declaration shall express the volume at 40°F (4°C); 
(c) in units of linear measure shall be in terms of the yard, foot, or inch; 
(d) in units of area measure, shall be in terms of the square yard, square foot, or square inch; 
(e) in units of dry measure shall be in terms of the United States bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, or peck, dry-quart, and dry-pint subdivisions of the bushel; 
(f) in units of cubic measure shall be in terms of the cubic yard, cubic foot, or cubic inch: Provided, that in the case of a commodity packed for export shipment, the declaration of quantity may be in terms of the metric system of weight or measure. 
(6) Abbreviations. Any of the following abbreviations, and none other, may be employed in the quantity statement on a package of commodity:
	avoirdupois 		avdp 		quart 		qt 
	cubic 			cu 		square 		sq 
	feet or foot	 	ft 		weight 		wt 
	fluid 			fl 		yard 		yd 
	gallon 			gal 		cubic centimeter cc 
	inch 			in 		gram 		g 
	liquid 			liq 		kilogram 	kg 
	ounce 			oz 		microgram 	mcg 
	pint 			pt		milligram 	mg 
	pound 			lb 		milliliter 	ml 
(There normally are no periods following, nor plural forms of, these abbreviations. For example, "oz" is the abbreviation for both "ounce" and "ounces.")
 (7) Units with Two or More Meanings. When the term "ounce" is employed in a declaration of liquid quantity, the declaration shall identify the particular meaning of the term by the use of the term "fluid"; however, such distinction may be omitted when, by association of terms (for example, as in "1 pint 4 ounces"), the proper meaning is obvious. Whenever the declaration of quantity is in terms of the dry pint or dry quart, the declaration shall include the word "dry." 
(8) Prescribed Units. 
      (a) Less than One Foot, One Square Foot, One Pound, or One Pint. The declaration of quantity shall
            be expressed in terms of 
	1. in the case of length measure of less than one foot, inches and fractions of inches; 
	2. in the case of area measure of less than one square foot, square inches and fractions of 	  	    square inches; 
	3. in the case of weight of less than one pound, ounces and fractions of ounces; 
	4. in the case of fluid measure of less than one pint, ounces and fractions of ounces; 
	Provided, that the quantity declaration appearing on a random package may be expressed in terms of decimal fractions of the largest appropriate unit, the fraction being carried out to not more than two decimal places. 
    (b) Four Feet, Four Square Feet, Four Pounds, One Gallon or More. In the case of 
1. length measure of four feet or more the declaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of feet, followed in parentheses by a declaration of yards and common or decimal fractions of the yard, or in terms of feet followed in parentheses by a declaration of yards with any remainder in terms of feet and inches. In the case of 
2. area measure of four square feet or more; 
3. weight of four pounds or more; 
4. fluid measure of one gallon or more the declaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of the largest whole unit. 

(c) Weight: Dual Quantity Declaration. On packages containing one pound or more but less than four pounds, the declaration shall be expressed in ounces and, in addition, shall be followed by declaration of parentheses, expressed in terms of the largest whole unit: Provided, that the quantity declaration appearing on a random package maybe expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than two decimal places. 
(d) Fluid Measure: Dual Quantity Declaration. On packages containing one pint or more but less than one gallon, the declaration shall be expressed in ounces and, in addition, shall be followed by a declaration in parentheses, expressed in terms of the largest whole unit. 
(e) Length Measure: Dual Quantity Declaration. On packages containing one foot but less than four feet, the declaration shall be expressed in inches and, in addition, shall be followed by a declaration in parentheses, expressed in terms of the largest whole unit. 
(f) Area Measure: Dual Quantity Declaration. On packages containing one square foot but less than four square feet, the declaration shall be expressed in square inches and, in addition, shall be followed by a declaration in parentheses, expressed in terms of the largest whole unit. 
(g) Bidimensional Commodities. For bidimensional commodities (including roll-type commodities) the quantity declaration shall be expressed, 
	1. if less than one square foot, in terms of linear inches and fractions of linear inches; 
	2. if at least one square foot but less than four square feet, in terms of square inches followed in parentheses by a declaration of both the length and width, each being in terms of the largest whole unit: 
Provided, that no square inch declaration is required for a bidimensional commodity of four inches width or less; a dimension of less than two feet may be stated in inches within the parenthetical; and commodities consisting of usable individual units (except roll-type commodities with individual usable units created by perforations, for which see 202 CMR 3.07(5)

(h). Count: Ply) require a declaration of unit area but not a declaration of total area of all such units; if four square feet or more, in terms of square feet followed in parentheses by a declaration of the length and width in terms of the largest whole unit: Provided, that no declaration in square feet is required for a bidimensional commodity with a width of four inches or less; a dimension of less than two feet may be stated in inches within the parenthetical; and no declaration in square feet is required for commodities for which the length and width measurements are critical in terms of end use (such as tablecloths or bed sheets) if such commodities clearly present the length and width measurements on the label. (h) Count: Ply. If the commodity is in individually usable units of one or more components or ply, the quantity declaration shall, in addition to complying with other applicable quantity declaration requirements of this regulation, include the number of ply and the total number of usable units. 
	Roll-type commodities, when perforated so as to identify individual usable units, shall not be deemed to be made up of usable units; however, such roll-type commodities shall be labeled in terms of total area measurement, number of ply, count of usable units, and dimensions of a single usable unit. 

(9) Fractions. A statement of net quantity of contents of any consumer commodity may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of 1/2's, 1/4's, c's, 1/16's, or 1/32's. except that 
	(a) if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing         	different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may 	be employed, and 
	(b) if linear measurements are required in terms of yards or feet, common fractions may be in 	terms of a's. 
A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. 

(10) Supplementary Declarations. 
	(a) Supplementary Quantity Declarations. The required quantity declaration may be supplemented by one or more declarations of weight, measure, or count, such declaration appearing other than on a principal display panel. Such supplemental statement of quantity of contents shall not include any terms qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count, that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity contained in the package (e.g., "giant" quart, "full" gallon, "when packed," "minimum," or words of similar import). 
	(b) Metric System Declarations. A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement, and a statement of quantity in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels. 
(11) Qualification of Declaration Prohibited. In no case shall any declaration of quantity be qualified by the addition of the words "when packed," "minimum," or "not less than," or any words of similar import, nor shall any unit of weight, measure, or count be qualified by any term (such as "jumbo," "giant," "full," or the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity. 

3.08: Declaration of Quantity: Non-consumer Packages 

	(1) Location. A Non-consumer package shall bear on the outside a declaration of the net 	quantity of contents. Such declaration shall be in terms of the largest whole unit (see 202 CMR 	3.07(1) Largest Whole Unit). 

	(2) Terms: Weight, Liquid Measure, or Count. The declaration of the quantity of a particular 	commodity shall be expressed in terms of liquid measure if the commodity is liquid, or in terms 	of weight if the commodity is solid, semisolid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid, or in 	terms of numerical count. However, if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage 	and trade custom with respect to the terms used in expressing a declaration of quantity of a 	particular commodity, such declaration of quantity may be expressed in its traditional terms, if 	such traditional declaration gives accurate and adequate information as to the quantity of the 	commodity. 

(3) Units: Weight, Measure. A declaration of quantity 
	(a)  in units of weight shall be in terms of the avoirdupois pound or ounce; 
	(b)  in units of liquid measure shall be in terms of the United States gallon of 231 cubic inches or 	liquid-quart, liquid-pint, or fluid-ounce subdivisions of the gallon, and shall express the volume 	at 68°F (20°C), except in the case of petroleum products, for which the declaration shall express 	the volume at 60°F (15.6°C), and except also in the case of a commodity that is normally sold 	and consumed while frozen, for which the declaration shall express the volume at the frozen 	temperature, and except also in the case of a commodity that is normally sold in the 	refrigerated state, for which the declaration shall express the volume at 40°F (4°C); 
	(c)  in units of linear measure shall be in terms of the yard, foot, or inch; 
	(d)  in units of area measure, shall be in terms of the square yard, square foot, or square inch; 	(e) in units of dry measure shall be in terms of the United States bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, 	or peck, dry-quart and dry-pint subdivisions of the bushel; 
	(f)  in units of cubic measure shall be in terms of the cubic yard, cubic foot, or cubic inch: 	Provided, that nothing in 202 CMR 3.08(3) shall prohibit the labeling of Non-consumer packages 	in terms of units of the metric system. 

(4) Abbreviations. Any generally accepted abbreviation of a unit name may be employed in the quantity 	statement on a package of commodity. (For commonly accepted abbreviations, see 202 CMR 	3.07(6) Abbreviations.) 

(5) Character of Declaration: Average. The average quantity of contents in the package of a particular lot, shipment, or delivery shall at least equal the declared quantity, and no unreasonable shortage in any package shall be permitted, even though overages in other packages in the same shipment, delivery, or lot compensate for such shortage. 



3.09: Prominence and Placement: Consumer Packages 

(1) General. All information required to appear on a consumer package shall appear thereon in the English language and shall be prominent, definite, and plain, and shall be conspicuous as to size and style of letters and numbers and as to color of letters and numbers in contrast to color of background.

The declaration or declarations of quantity shall be in such a style 	of type or lettering as to be boldly, clearly, and conspicuously presented with respect to other 	type, lettering, or graphic material on the package, except that a declaration of net quantity 	blown, formed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information 	is blown, formed, or molded on the surface. 
	(c) Color Contrast. The declaration or declarations of quantity shall be in a color that contrasts 	conspicuously with its background, except that a declaration of net quantity blown, formed, or 	molded on a glass or plastic surface shall not be required to be presented in a contrasting color 	if no required label information is on the surface in a contrasting color. 
(d) Free Area. The area surrounding the quantity declaration shall be free of printed information 
      1. above and below, by a space equal to at least the height of the lettering in the declaration, and 
      2. to the left and right, by a space equal to twice the width of the letter "N" of the style and size of type used in the declaration. 

(e) Parallel Quantity Declaration. The quantity declaration shall be presented in such a manner as to be generally parallel to the declaration of identity and to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.

(2) Calculation of Area of Principal Display Panel for Purposes of Type Size. The square- inch area of the principal display panel shall be 
	(a) in the case of a rectangular container, one entire side which properly can be considered to be 	the principal display panel, the product of the height times the width of that side; 
	(b) in the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40% of the product of the height of 	the container times the circumference; or

3.11: Requirements: Specific Consumer Commodities, Packages, Containers 
	(1) Display Card Package. For an individual package affixed to a display card, or for a 	commodity and display card together comprising a package, the type size of the quantity 	declaration is governed by the dimensions of the display card.
	 (2) Eggs. When cartons containing 12 eggs have been designed so as to permit division in half by 	the retail purchaser, the required quantity declaration shall be so positioned as to have its 	context   	destroyed when the carton is divided. 
	(3) Aerosols and Similar Pressurized Containers. The declaration of quantity on an aerosol 	package, and on a similar pressurized package, shall disclose the net quantity of the commodity 	(including propellant), in terms of weight, that will be expelled when the instructions for use as 	shown on the container are followed. 
	(4) Multi-Unit Packages. Any package containing more than one individual "commodity in 	package form" (see 202 CMR 3.03(1)) of the same commodity shall bear on the outside of the 	package a declaration of 
		(a) the number of individual units, 
		(b) the quantity of each individual unit, and 
		(c) the total quantity of the contents of the multi-unit package: Provided, that the 			      requirement for a declaration of the total quantity of contents of a multi-unit package shall be effective with respect to those labels revised after the effective date of this regulation, or as of January 1, 1970, whichever occurs first. Any such declaration of total quantity shall not be required to include the parenthetical quantity statement of a dual quantity representation. 
(5) Combination Packages. Any package containing individual units of dissimilar commodities (such as an antiquing kit, for example) shall bear on the label of the package a quantity declaration for each unit. 
(6) Variety Packages. Any package containing individual units of reasonably similar commodities (such as, for example, seasonal gift packages, variety packages of cereal) shall bear on the label of the package a declaration of the total quantity of commodity in the package. 
(7) Cylindrical Containers. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40% of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. 
(8) Measurement of Container-Type Commodities, How Expressed. 
     (a) General. Commodities designed and sold at retail to be used as containers for other materials or objects, such as bags, cups, boxes, and pans, shall be labeled with the declaration of net quantity as follows: 
       1. For bag-type commodities, in terms of count followed by linear dimensions of the bag (whether packaged in a perforated roll or otherwise).
	 When the unit bag is characterized by two dimensions because of the absence of a gusset, the width and length will be expressed in inches, except that a dimension of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot. (Example: "25 bags, 17 in x 20 in" or "100 bags, 20 in x 2 ft 6 in" or "50 bags, 20 in x 21/2 ft.") 
	When the unit bag is gusseted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth, and length, in terms of inches, except that any dimension of two feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal fractions of the foot. (Examples: "25 bags, 17 in. x 4 in x 20 in" or "100 bags, 20 in x 12 x 21/2 ft."). 
    2. For other square, oblong, rectangular, or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width, and depth, except depth need not be listed when less than two inches. (Example: "2 cake pans, 8 in x 8 in" or "roasting pan, 12 in x 8 in x 3 in.") 
   3. For circular or other generally round-shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed by diameter and depth, except depth need not be listed when less than two inches. (Example: "4 pie pans, 8 in diameter x 4 in.")
 (b) Capacity. When the functional use of the container is related by label references in standard terms of measure to the capability of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity statement and shall specify capacity as follows: 
     1. Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semisolids, viscous materials, or mixtures of solids and liquids. The expressed capacity will be stated in terms of the largest whole unit (gallon, quart, pint, ounce), with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit. (Example: Freezer Boxes -- "4 boxes, 1-qt capacity, 5 in x 4 in x 3 in.") 
     2. Dry measure for containers which are intended to be used for solids. The expressed capacity will be stated in terms of the largest whole unit (bushel, peck), with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit. (Example: Leaf Bags -- "8 bags, 6-bushel capacity, 3 ft x 5 ft.") 
     3. Where containers are used as liners for other more permanent containers, in the same terms as are normally used to express the capacity of the more permanent container. (Example: Garbage Can Liners -- "10 liners, 2 ft 6 in x 3 ft 9 in, fits up to 30-gallon cans.") Notwithstanding the above requirements, the net quantity statement for containers such as cups will be listed in terms of count and liquid capacity per unit. (Example: "24 cups, 6 fl oz capacity.") For purposes of 202 CMR 3.11(8), the use of the terms "capacity," "diameter," and "fluid" is optional. 

(9) Textile Products, Threads, and Yarns. 
(a) Wearing Apparel. Wearing apparel (including non-textile apparel and accessories such as leather goods and footwear) sold as single-unit items, or if normally sold in pairs (such as hosiery, gloves, and shoes) sold as single-unit pairs, shall be exempt from the requirements for a net quantity statement by count, as required by 202 CMR 3.07(3). 
(b) Textiles.

Variations above the declared quantity shall not be unreasonably large. 
		(b) Variations Resulting from Exposure. Variations from the declared weight or measure 			shall be permitted when caused by ordinary and customary exposure to conditions that 			normally occur in good distribution practice and that unavoidably result in change of 			weight or measure, but only after the commodity is introduced into intrastate 				commerce: 
		Provided, that the phrase "introduced into intrastate commerce" as used in 202 CMR 			3.13(1)(b) shall be construed to define the time and the place at which the first sale and 			delivery of a package is made within the state, the delivery being either 
			1. directly to the purchaser or to his agent, or 
			2. to a common carrier for shipment to the purchaser, and this paragraph shall 				be construed as requiring that, so long as a shipment, delivery, or lot of 					packages of a particular commodity remains in the possession or under the 				control of the packager or the person who introduces the package into 					intrastate commerce, exposure variations shall not be permitted. 

(27) Magnitude of Permitted Variations. The magnitude of variations permitted under 202 CMR 3.13, 3.13(1), 3.13(1)(a), and 3.13(1)(b) shall, in the case of any shipment, delivery, or lot, be determined by the facts in the individual case.

This exemption shall apply solely to the use of an understandable abbreviation of item description or price size in locations where shelf space devoted to the item is limited, such as in spice display locations. In reaching a decision, the Director of Standards shall take into consideration the prominence of the price segment of the label, the boldness and size of the characters, and the overall design of the label. 

7.07: Lowest Price Requirements 
(1) If there is a discrepancy between the advertised price, the sticker price, the scanner price, or the display price and the checkout price on any grocery item, a food store or food department shall charge a consumer the lowest price, regardless of the pricing system employed by the food store or food department.

If the consumer purchases an item that qualifies for a discount granted for presenting a loyalty card, the amount saved shall both be reflected in the checkout price charged and separately listed on the consumer's itemized sales receipt. 

7.09: Consumer Rights Disclosures

(7) Notwithstanding the method for determining the amount of civil fines under M.G.L. c. 98, § 29A, a civil citation may be issued for $200 for each violation, up to a maximum of $5,000 per inspection, for a food store or a food department utilizing a consumer price scanner system. Notwithstanding the method for determining the amount of civil fines under M.G.L. c. 98, § 29A, a civil citation may be issued for $100 per violation, up to a maximum of $2,500 per inspection, for a food store or food department utilizing an individual pricing system. 
(8) For purposes of 202 CMR 7.10, each occasion that an item scans erroneously during an inspector's attempt to verify its correct price shall constitute a separate civil violation. Inspectors shall not scan any identical individual item more than once per inspection. The seller shall immediately correct all violations. 
(9) For a food store or a food department utilizing a consumer price scanner system, if an item is advertised either in a food store, food department or in a circular as on sale or discounted because of a loyalty card price and the item registers at a higher price at the checkout counter than indicated by a sale or loyalty card price, a civil citation shall be issued for $300 for each violation, up to a maximum of $5,000 per inspection. Said loyalty card violations shall be calculated separately from other pricing violations for purposes of the $5,000 caps. 
(10) The Deputy Director shall not issue a fine under M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E and M.G.L. c. 98, § 56D for the same violation.

(12) The food store or food department shall immediately correct any noncompliance with 
M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E when notified by the inspector.

A fine shall be issued upon verification of any consumer complaint alleging overcharging or improper price marking. 
 
(15) If the Deputy Director determines that a food store or food department is either intentionally or through gross negligence violating any provisions of M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E, the Deputy Director shall provide written notice of such determination to the food store or food department and the food store or food department shall have 30 days to cure these violations. Provided, however, that pricing violations shall be corrected immediately upon notice. If upon re-inspection the Deputy Director determines that the food store or food department is still not in substantial compliance with 202 CMR 7.00 and M.G.L. c. 194, §§ 184B through 184E, all of the food store's or food department's exemptions shall be rescinded for a period of 12 months, and the matter shall be referred to the Attorney General for action against that food store or food department. 
(16) M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E shall only apply to food stores and to grocery items in food departments. M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E shall not diminish any obligations under other laws or regulations regarding item pricing for sellers other than food stores or for items other than grocery items in food departments. If a seller is also subject to the item pricing regulations or guidelines of another agency, in cases where a specified number of items is allowed to be exempted under two similar exceptions to the requirement of item pricing, such similar provisions shall not be additive. Compliance with another agency's regulations or guidelines shall not be a defense to a violation of M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E or 202 CMR 7.00.

(a) A food store or food department using a consumer price scanner system shall be subject to inspection by the Deputy Director; 
(b) The Deputy Director shall not cause any food store or food department using a consumer price scanner system to be inspected more than once per calendar month, unless within the previous 30 days there is a verified pattern of consumer complaints, or, upon regular inspection, the food store or food department is not in compliance with 202 CMR 7.00 or M.G.L. c. 94, §§ 184B through 184E, the division may inspect a food store or food department using a consumer pricing scanner system once every week until the food store or food department is found to be in compliance;

(d) The food store or food department's number and type of scanners shall be sufficient for the food store or food department's size as defined by 202 CMR 7.00. Any violation of 202 CMR 7.10(17)(d), lacking the requisite number and type of consumer pricing scanners shall result in a fine of $1,000, which shall not count toward the maximum fine established under section 202 CMR 7.10(17)(g), provided, however, that the Deputy Director may reduce this fine consistent with M.G.L. c. 98, § 29A; 
(e) An inspector may choose to test a consumer price scanner system for accuracy. The inspector may choose the sample size for accuracy tests provided that the size of sample is not less than 50 items and not more than 200 items; 
(f) Any scanning that yields an incorrect price that causes a food store or food department's consumer price scanner accuracy rating to fall below 98% shall constitute a separate violation. 202 CMR 7.10(17)(d) shall not be used to impact a scanner's pass or fail grade, but the cumulative violations of 202 CMR 7.10(17)(f) in any particular store or department shall be used in contributing toward the maximum fine imposed; 
(g) Each consumer price scanner shall be graded on a pass or fail basis by inspectors. A failing consumer price scanner shall include, but not be limited to:
