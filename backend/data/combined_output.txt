Welcome ‘Aboard

February, 2004
This report is brought to you by your Massachusetts Weights & Measures Association.

I first wrote this report in response to a perceived need. The Division of Standards
sends a package of information to all new Sealers but it is focused, as it should be, on the
state law. The Division is limited on what it can say. I found there was no source available
for all the little details that help this job make sense. I was not alone in feeling unprepared for
the job. Given that there is usually only one Sealer in Town there just was not a lot of
information available. I started asking questions and taking notes. These reports are a
collection of what I found.

I need to thank all of you who have found value in what I have written and said so. It
is always nice to get positive feedback.

The original report was distributed in early 2001 and proved so popular we had to go
to reprints in October 2003. The need is still there as new people are appointed. It is a look at
what we do as Sealers.

Thope this reflects some of what the new Sealer needs to know. Making this
document available does not imply endorsement and the contents are entirely my
responsibility, mistakes and all. The opinions are mine but they are based on inputs from
many Sealers.

This book is an expansion of the earlier book and it includes much taken from
meetings over the years. Thank you for helping me develop this document.

Introduction

Welcome to the always-interesting world of Weights and Measures as practiced in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This report is a cobbled assembly of tips opinions and
facts gleaned from a few years of attending meetings, completing 5 correspondence courses ,
a few NIST courses on related topics and digesting the great deal of information shared by
the old hands. The training given at meetings is also invaluable. Many long term Sealers are
always there and have been very generous with time and help. If you want help it will
probably be there. In particular I have to recognize the efforts of the Boys and Girls from
Barnstable. The Sealers/ Inspectors from the Cape gave much time to help me and others
learn some of the ropes. Steve Agostinelli has been mentor, instructor and overall guru for
others and myself. The Division of Standards took me in and helped me get up to speed on
some aspects of this work. They too deserve thanks. I have had help in reviewing this from
various members of the Executive Committee of the Mass. Weights and Measures
Association.

There is nothing here that will “make you a Sealer”. I will not be addressing the specifics
of testing and evaluation. I will be giving you information to supplement the sometimes-dry
technical language found in the laws and NIST Handbooks. I also hope to share tips and
background information. ;

In piecing this revised edition together I have used a lot of sources from the Sealer
community. I have to acknowledge copying some information generously offered. This
revision probably would not work but for the “new” information added. Some of this
collected wisdom comes from people who have been around so long the original study
courses were written on clay tablets.

I am assuming that most of you reading this will be new to the job. The purpose here
is to share some heads up information. This report will hopefully address the gaps in
information and at least point you to the answers. I will not be quoting much law here but
will be sharing some conventional wisdom. I will endeavor not to give you any bad
information. I would appreciate any constructive criticism.

The Division of Standards will have sent you an information package containing the
appropriate laws and regulations. It will also address the entire process of getting and
remaining certified. They will also send you the form for the current years Annual Report. It
is not expected to change from year to year. I have included the current one for you to see
what information you will need to gather. Some Sealers have the Annual Report on a
template in their computers and only have to fill in the blanks. For those of you on the cutting
edge ask around at the next meeting, someone will have it.

The information presented here will duplicate some of the information in the package
sent out by the Division. It is repeated here because even the old hands will get this and the
information is still valid.

I believe it is important that you know that Sealing in this millennium is just NOT the
cakewalk that some old heads remember, if indeed it ever was. I still encounter new Sealers
who took the job with no clue as to the broad areas, which we cover. They rely on a distant
memory of what some old timer did or did not do a few years ago. This is “not your fathers
Oldsmobile.” Things have really changed. The electronic age has brought us remarkable
levels of accuracy but it has also brought a more sophisticated technology. At the same time a
huge increase in the volume and value of goods has occurred. We inspect and test but do far
less adjusting than before. There may be some seriously uninformed people out there that
you may have to educate a bit to get your salary or expenses updated. The changes in
technology and commerce have been dramatic yet many jurisdictions operate today as though
nothing has changed in the last 25 or 50 years. That is a mistake, as you will come to
understand.

In this report I am just scratching the surface of the information you will need to
“have. 1 am making no attempt to usurp anyone else’s turf or to interpret laws and regulations.
Apply what you learn here then modify it to fit you. Many jurisdictions have a wide variety
of equipment to test and inspect. Some are very specialized. Some of you will have
production facilities and a few will have rail yards. A lucky few will have only digital scales,
modem gas pumps, no oil trucks or taximeters and adequate pay and tools.

Disclaimer

In this document a number of sources and service providers are mentioned. I am
referring to the equipment you will be using or renting. You should know that in all cases
there is likely a wider selection available. Consult with others in the industry or the Division
of Standards office. In the performance of your duties an owner might ask you for advice, on
locating a new scale or service provider. The very best advice you can give would be to refer
all queries to the yellow pages. Do not get caught up in the recommending game.

Equity in the Market Place

Is the short name for what we strive to achieve. An excellent summary of activities
can be found in Handbook 82 on Weights and Measures Administration. “The importance to
a community of adequate weights and measures supervision can scarcely be overestimated.
Next to the personal safety and health of the people, one of the most important of the
fundamental obligations of the State or municipality to its citizens is this of the regulation of
commercial weighing and measuring instruments and the exercise of reasonable control over
the users thereof. There is no single individual in a community whose interests are not
affected by these considerations, for weighing and measuring operations, to a greater or
lesser degree, enter into the distribution of all the necessities of life, particularly of food and
fuel.”

“ The functions of the weights and measures official are to safeguard the entire public
whom he (she) serves in all matters involving the commercial determination of quantity — to
see to it that, whenever merchandise or service is bought or sold by weight or measure, a just


=== Image (6).jpg ===

weight or a just measure is delivered, and that fraud, carelessness and misrepresentation in all
“quantity” aspects of such transactions are eliminated.”

Division of Standards

The Boss ( Commissioner ) is David Rodrigues. The Assistant
Director is Mark Merante. The phone number is 617-727-3480.

The Training Officer conducts the testing and record keeping for the initial

~ qualification and ongoing required training. Steve also coilates the annual reports you will be

submitting each January . He has other duties within the Division as assigned.
The comissioner and director attend many of our meetings so you can usually speak to
someone from the Division of Standards on a face-to-face basis.

There are several others who spend much time in the field. If you have a problem in
the field it is likely that the commissioner will dispatch an Inspector to your aid if the matter cannot
be resolved over the phone. A list of the Division of Standards Inspectors and telephone
numbers is appended. The Field Inspectors from the Division usually attend the statewide
meetings of this association. Thus you can nurture a working relationship with the people
who will come to your assistance when needed.

These Inspectors are responsible for enforcement of Standards including
those of concern to us and for many specialized tests. They also perform random inspections
in all jurisdictions and carry out programs set up by the Division of Standards. They can and
do come to your community on a random basis to see if all is going well. Usually you will
not know they have been there unless a problem is revealed.

The Division also handles the licensing for Hawkers and Peddlers, Transient
Vendors, Auctioneers, Motor Vehicle Fuel and Oil Dealers and Automobile Damage Repair
Shops.

They are very helpful as a resource to any one trying to get started and to help when
things get tough.

This is the Office that gets your Annual Report in January.
METROLOGY

This is a fancy name for the science of precise measurements and the associated
calibration of equipment. Ray Costa, State Metrologist & Laboratory Manager and Hain "Will' Setow Call Division of Standards Metrology Lab, Hain "Will' Setow at(508) 532-1200, manages the state lab and he
will be happy to help you with questions about the condition and testing of your equipment.
There is certain preparatory work he would ask you to do prior to bringing your equipment to
him. He will want the heavier 20# weights and any heavier ones cleaned and serialized. Each


=== Image (7).jpg ===

weight will need to be identifiable by using a serial number or some other means of
differentiating them. None of this stuff can be rusty. There is a decided movement away from
the 50# weights for obvious reasons. Before you abandon yours recheck the amounts of
weight you will need to comply with the requirements of Handbook 44

Ray will want your motor fuel test measure rinsed out with water and dried out. He
will also want you to leave it all with him for perhaps a few weeks depending on the
workload. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Metrology Lab is now located at 250 Eliot Street, Suite 10-D, Ashland, MA 01721.  This is the same location the Division of
Standards is using for classroom space.

You can expect rejection of any weights that are brass, except as noted below, or
some that have handles that twist off to access the adjustments. Test Measures that are
leaking or have broken components will likely be rejected. The State iab does not do repairs.

In the State of Massachusetts it is expected that your basic equipment will be retested
by the state lab on a regular basis in order to insure accuracy and compliance with other
metrology standards. Test Standards permanently installed in trucks or trailers are good for
five years since they do not get banged around. The five gallon prover that sees limited usage
and no abuse can go for up to five years between calibration while the provers that see heavy
use or suffer the indignity of dents and dings need to come in much more often. Remember, a
dented device may well be no longer accurate.

Stainless Steel weights that have been carefully handled and have no corrosion or other
defects can go five years also. If they get dropped or spilled onto the ground, or lobster tank,
they need to go back for recalibration.

The large provers, over ten gallons, need to be tested outside the state lab. Please arrange
with Donny Smith, in advance to do this work during reasonable weather. There are no
provisions for overnight stowage of equipment outside.

Ray Costa can be reached at  Call Division of Standards Metrology Lab, Hain "Will' Setow at(508) 532-1200. That is his lab telephone number at 250 Eliot Street, Suite 10-D, Ashland, MA 01721

Notes:
Grip weights are those weights, not part of a kit, that have a handle cast into the
weight itself. The older but still serviceable ones are cast iron and the newer ones are

stainless steel.

5 and 10 pound grip weights are no longer recognized in MA. If you are going to
order any 5 and /or 10 pound weights get the cylindrical stainless steel one now available.

For a Sealer using only field standards the weights do not need to be serialized or
otherwise identified. The lab will stamp their mark on them.

If ordering new 20/25/50 pound or up grip weights have the manufacturer stamp them
with identifying data. This is not a requirement but would prove helpful.


=== Image (8).jpg ===

This is what the efforts of the State Lab are all about. The lab is the key link in the chain
between the local sealers equipment and the national standards.

Traceability

All equipment used to measure in the world of metrology must conform to some very
specific standards. The standards are in Handbook 105 of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology. They are derived from the ISO 9000 series of standards, which contain the
International Standards Organizations specifications for metrological accuracy. In short your
one-pound weight is measured against the Commonwealths one-pound weight and
determined to be within acceptable tolerances. The state weights are measured against the
national standard weights, which are in turn validated against the international standards.
Thus that weight rattling around, hopefully not, is part of a long tradition and a very accurate
measure. A letter is issued to you certifying that your weight is a legal weight against which,
under state law, you can compare and test scales. This same business applies to ALL of the
weights you might use and ALL of the liquid measuring devices you might employ. Let us
not forget that linear measuring devices are a part of this program. Think about that pencil
marked measurement at the hardware store worktable when you bought some screening. The
liquid measuring standards are calibrated in cubic inches with the same accuracy standards as
are applied to our weights.

Without the Traceability or the ability to trace the accuracy of your weights and measures to
the state standards you could be on thin ice in either sealing or not sealing a device.

Notes:

Some people seem to take a perverse pride in not having their Field Standards
certified by the State Lab. It is possible they are lazy, but the Traceability is just not there.
This is leaving a hole in the program big enough to drive a truck through. How can a Sealer
accurately calibrate a fuel meter if the accuracy of his prover is questionable?

There are a large number of jurisdictions that have never (or at least in the last ten
years) brought their equipment in for certification. If you have not, then by all means get that
equipment tested in order to be able to do your job more professionally

' Pharmacists can and do use brass weights for their balances. If they are in good
physical shape and test within tolerance they are acceptable.

Only the Sealers with brass weights that are on record at the metrology lab may use
them. No new weight sets made of brass will be allowed.

Administration

Organization

In some jurisdictions the Sealer is a stand-alone department developing its own
budget and local reporting requirements. Some are integrated into the Building Inspectors
Department. There are some communities that have a Director of Inspectional Services.
These often include the Weights and Measures function just as it contains the Board of
Health as well as the electrical and plumbing code enforcement component. In this structure
the budget and salary issues are handled as a part of a larger budget. In addition to the
statutory requirements for reporting to the Division you will likely have to prepare a written
report for the jurisdictions Annual Report. The contents of that report are not predetermined.
Some Sealers choose to report device numbers and / or fees collected. This exposes you to
negative comments when the income you produce is far below the cost of having a Sealer.

Some communities have budgeted amounts for general expenses including uniform
items, membership expenses for our professional, mileage, education expenses, equipment
expenses as well as salary.

The question of adequate storage for your equipment needs to be addressed. If you
are content storing everything at your home and if the Town has no problem with that then go
with it. It is a responsibility to keep that equipment safe from damage and loss. I have seen
the grip weights used as doorstops at Town Hall. This is not a proper way to store them.

Some communities provide a vehicle for both the storage of the Sealers equipment
and transportation. If you are offered a choice, a pickup with a cap is a better choice than a
van because you will not be exposed to the benzene fumes of gasoline or the general
unpleasantness of diesel fuel odors.

More and more jurisdictions require that all transactions be paid by check and do not
want Sealers handling cash. That is their call but it can increase the workload slightly. One
reason’ for this local no cash policy is to protect you from any allegations of impropriety. The
accountability can get difficult because not all stores or service stations can issue a check on
the spot. You can consider stapling your card to the invoice you leave behind. That way you
are assured the correct address and names are used.

Fee Schedule

State law in Chapter 98 established a fee schedule for sealing various weighing and
measuring devices. It also allows cities and towns to set fees. Those fees in the law are quite
out of date and most jurisdictions have revised their fee schedules to more appropriate levels.
IF YOUR FEE SCHEDULE IS FIVE YEARS OLD OR OLDER YOU NEED TO
UPDATE IT. The Consumer and Merchant Protection Act of 1998 added fees for scanner


=== Image (10).jpg ===

systems. These are locked in the law. Some communities strive to set the fee schedule at a
level to reflect the actual cost of providing the service. Most do not.

In addition to the fees provided for under the Weights and Measures laws there is
Section 123 of Chapter 138 of the Acts of 1991 (Adding G.L. Ch.40, S.22F). This is a local
option which if accepted by the community allows local jurisdiction to set reasonable fees
and charges. This is the place where the authority to exceed the mandated state fee levels is
found. It is also the place that allows a jurisdiction to set a fee for services not included in the
state law. As with all laws you need to read the actual law to insure you do not cross some
line.

If adopted, and I will bet most towns have, then there is NO NEED for Town Meeting or City
Council action in order to set or raise fees. Again, go to the actual law. I have appended some
references to the law.

With current statewide-figures you might be able to lead your community to update the local
fee schedule. This could help you on the salary side of the issues. The Mass. Weights and
Measures Association collects information from sealers about fees and shares the
information. At the back of this report you will find a form called a Survey Update. Please
photocopy the form complete the information and send it to the New Bedford address. If you
have not submitted that information in the recent past please do it now. Whenever a salary or
fee schedule changes it will be helpful if you will tell us. In this way your association can
help you.

Compensation

Given that the range of work varies widely it is a delicate issue to make suggestions
concerning pay. We have a lot of full time sealers especially in the cities while in the smaller
towns The Mass. Weights and Measures Association is collecting this information on a
voluntary basis from members. This information will be made available from time to time in
order to assist you in determining an acceptable level of pay. One great danger is when the
boss tries to count the devices and figure your pay accordingly. That attitude fails to
acknowledge all the other work you are required by law to accomplish and ignores the
professionalism of the job.

' It should be noted that there are other components than pay. Allowances for
education, uniforms, mileage, professional memberships and dues, conferences, etc. are hard
to compare with another jurisdiction. In some communities the sealer is provided with an
office and support, possibly a truck, and often storage for equipment. In some towns the
Sealer works out of his house/garage

Other Sealers

Included in this report is a list of sealers by jurisdiction including phone numbers. It is a
dynamic list and will constantly change but on 1/1/04 it was accurate. There is also a


=== Image (11).jpg ===

summary of the code letters to be used in the course of your sealing duties. This list is very
stable.

Massachusetts Municipal Association (MMA)

The MMA is a group of communities that band together to share information on local
government. They cover a lot of topics but the specific one of interest to you will be the
compensation study. You should know that each member community shares the salary data.
There is a separate book for Police, Fire, Unions and others. That information might be what
your boss is looking at when he thinks about your pay. The data does NOT have any info on
numbers of devices, mileage, training, supplies or any other breakdowns. I published an
extract of the 2001 report in March 2002 and another extract is included with this report. In
this current report 268 communities have contributed.

Record Keeping / Reporting

The Consumer and Merchant Protection Act of 1998 placed specific reporting
requirements on us. The old annual reports are now history and the new forms are in use.
They require far more details about your work. The recording of values from totalizers and
other information has become essential. Appended you will find the January 2004 report. It is
included to allow you to pre-gather the information in preparation for future annual reports.
The Division will send to you the Annual Report for your preparation. I expect the reports to
evolve over time and perhaps begin to ask for additional information. You can use the
enclosed form to record and store some information for your jurisdiction. These annuai
reports will be available in an electronic format soon. There will always be the option for a
paper report.

Quite apart from any Division of Standards guidelines is a requirement under state
law for the preservation of records of Sealers of Weights and Measures. The disposal
schedule is specific so I would consult with the enclosed form before cleaning out the old
records. Some of them will have to be archived. The office ledger is a permanent record.

COMPLAINTS

When a citizen calls in a complaint about an apparent violation you are obliged to
look into it. If the call goes to the Division they will give it a file number and look into
the issue. They will then inform the local Sealer. The investigation of a complaint does

not trigger the fee schedule. Records must be kept of any complaint received and any
actions taken.

The W&M staff in Barnstable currently administers this group. The
Massachusetts Weights and Measures Association have a number of subcommittees that help
us perform our mission. A President, elected annually and guided by an executive Board
leads the state association. They usually hold a mid -term meeting in the winter and an annual
meeting in the fall. The location of these meetings changes on a regular basis. At all meetings
information is presented on the current affairs of the world of Metrology and what
information you can use to better do your job. Annual dues are $50.00

WHY GO TO MEETINGS?

I am convinced that the only way one can stay up to date with the changes happening
is to get a constant flow of new information. These meetings, those of the State and the
Regional Mass Weights and Measures Associations have proven to be rich sources of
information. I am familiar with the Eastern Mass Assoc. I am just as sure that the Western
Mass. meetings are equally informative. There are a lot of opinions about what should be
done in various situations. It is very useful to hear and share the experiences of some sealers.
It’s the “been there done that” school of information sharing but it indeed works. There is a
small amount of B.S. but you gradually figure out the players. Do not ever be reluctant to ask
a question at these meetings, you might trigger a lively debate.

’ Looking back I now realize that only a portion of the learning in this job happens
during the presentations at these meetings. A vast amount of knowledge is passed along in
the hallways, over lunch and during the “bull sessions”. Here is where you can get the
questions answered and opinions rendered.

Given that many of the active sealers have held their position for a long time it is
difficult to have agenda items that will appeal to many of them. There seems to be a
developing trend to review basic stuff about our job. That can only be productive.

The various associations have newsletters, which promulgate all kinds of news and

facts of value. The networking, handouts and free info alone make these meetings
worthwhile. The Division of Standards usually briefs us on recent developments and

-10-


=== Image (13).jpg ===

upcoming items of interest. Attendance at these meetings does count for continuing education
credits.

Certification

The position of Sealer of Weights and Measures was defined by what we do and was
lacking somewhat on the how we do it. As a result there were many disparate methods used
by the hundreds of Sealers that have passed through this job. In the search for ways to get
some standardization in this work and to insure the citizens of the Commonwealth were
better served, it became apparent that some level of certification was called for. Chapter 295
of the Acts of 1998 “The Consumer and Merchant Protection Act” was developed to address
that need. Among other things the Act requires-that all Weights and Measures officials
become certified after being appointed.

Certification is achieved by taking and passing a written test and passing a practical
(hands on) evaluation period with a State Inspector. Remember, the goal is standardization
and safety as well as adequate understanding of the task at hand. The focus is on the small
scale (30#) and the typical gasoline meter. These makes up the bulk of the devices Sealers
deal with. There is also an emphasis on understanding where and how to find information.
The written test covers such topics as the Massachusetts General Laws pertaining to Weights
and Measures, portions of HB-44 and the Scale Modules as well as the Motor Fuel Dispenser
Module. There are also some basic mathematical computations of the sort you would
_ encounter on the job.

Certification alone is but one component of the move toward professionalizing this
job. There is a requirement for continuing education in order to remain certified. Basically it
encourages attendance at association meetings and the formal training courses offered from
time to time.

Certification should be looked at as a minimum qualification on which to build.
There are other devices and programs, which have their own educational requirements in
order for you to properly inspect and test, as required.

Education and Training

The Division of Standards in conjunction with the several professional organizations
will be conducting training on a regular basis around the state. Membership in the various
organizations listed below will insure you are up to date on the latest offering. Continuing
education is now a requirement.

There is a certain amount of on the job training involved in this business but you
should know that there is some formal training available. The Mass. Weights and Measures
Association working with the Division of Standards has a series of formal training classes
based on NIST developed programs. This is a classroom environment usually lasting 2-5
days and often involving some hands on and or fieldwork. The typical class size is 25
students and a central location is generally chosen or the training is conducted twice to allow
a course in the eastern half and the western half of the state.

=== Image (14).jpg ===

There are NIST courses available for many of the devices you will be faced with.
These courses require a NIST trained instructor. When the manpower is available these
course are offered. Due to the cycle time before a course is offered again take any course that
becomes available if you have that device in your jurisdiction

Another choice could be the courses offered by Stabler Training Resources at 9497
Long Road, Ostrander, Ohio, 43061. Tele: 1-740-666-1908 or e-mail at
StablerTraining@Earthlink.net. I have completed five of these courses and find them to be
very intense but very thorough. These are correspondence courses each is made up of ten
lessons. I would suggest that you would get more from these courses if you do them with
someone with whom you can argue and defend your answers. You will likely need someone
to talk to while gaining this knowledge. The courses would be very difficult to attempt to do
alone if you do not have some prior knowledge’of the topic. When you have completed his
courses you will have a very in-depth knowledge of the subject. Tom Stabler is a well-known
expert in the metrology iridustry with plenty of credentials for his background.

The combination of some training by a friendly sealer or mentor, the working of the
courses and participation in the various continuing education programs will round out your
education. The one shortfall to getting all you know from one individual is that you pick up
his/her biases and or other misinformation without a context in which to evaluate it.

NTEP: NATIONAL TYPE EVALUATION PROGRAM

At the risk of sounding too technical you should know that many sealers function
without knowing anything about NTEP. I submit that in order for you to do your job to the
highest degree of professionalism you must be familiar with the NTEP program and use it.

CoC: Certificate of Conformance

In the 1980's the electronic age arrived in the field of metrology big time. The old
analog devices are being superceded by potentially very precise digital devices. The more
precise the ability of a device to measure then the more we demand of it. Every new device in
commercial service will have a Certificate of Conformance certifying that the device meets
some very specific standards as in Handbook #44. That Certificate, known to some as a
C.0.C or an NTEP Certificate is issued by the National Type Evaluation Program, NTEP. The
state of Massachusetts recognizes that authority and requires that a certificate be issued for
any new device employed in retail trade. The Commonwealth reserves the right to type


=== Image (15).jpg ===

approve devices in lieu of a CoC. One of the many reasons a certificate is valuable is that it
tells you as a Sealer some key information that is often not available elsewhere. Examples
will be cited later. The key here is that you do NOT have the authority to modify or amend a
CoC. or even to ignore it.

All of the Certificates were once published in Publication #5. All of the information
formerly available in Pub #5 is now found on line at the NCWM website. If you inherit a set
of volumes of Pub #5 place them in the archives or the trash as they will be seriously out of
date. One very effective way to be more accurate is to build a listing of the devices under
your jurisdiction. If you then obtain a copy of the certificate you will know the facts of the
legality of the device and have some key information needed by you to correctly do your job.
The C.0.C is the ONLY place where you can find out if a fish platter or a tare basket is
approved. If it is not listed on the Certificate of Conformance then it is not legal and you
cannot decide that it is O.K. Different size/shape platters get swapped with other scales
resulting in a scale that is no longer legal for trade. Copies of specific C.o.C ‘s can be
obtained from the Divisioir of Standards or from several jurisdictions around the state. For ene
those of you on the cutting edge or just looking for an excuse all C.o.C s are on the World
Wide Web of the Internet at the NIST website. (www//ntep.nist. aii ) These CoCs are
kept up to date by NCWM.

There are several different CoC’s appended for a variety of devices. They are typical
and should be examined for what they do specifically say and / or do not mention.

NOT LEGAL FOR TRADE

These scales will never have an accuracy class designation nor will they have a CoC.
They will have marked somewhere a statement affirming NOT FOR RETAIL TRADE. It just
does not get much clearer than that. These scales CAN NOT BE SEALED under state law for
use as a commercial weighing and measuring device. They constantly tum up in service so be
vigilant. Pelouze and Sunbeam are two makers of such scales; Some times you have to look
under the scale to find the markings. They need to be taken out of retail trade service
immediately.

At Dunkin Donuts if they weigh and grind right under your nose, it is not a pre pack;
lately Dunkys has begun to pre-pack at a central location. Many coffee shops roast and
package their own on premises.

ISO 9000

New equipment is appearing in the field with seals proclaiming / certifying
compliance with ISO-9000. Do not be mislead. ISO 9000 represents the International
Standards Organization program for very precise metrological standards. Many participants
have their own weights and volume standards, which have a traceability suitable for their
needs. All of this is for internal use in various manufacturing and quality assurance processes.
None of it has any thing to do with us in our role as Sealers. It is beyond our pay grade. The
results of the manufacturing process become of interest to us when the product enters the
commercial trade world. At that time you inspect and test to the standards adopted by the
Commonwealth and apply the appropriate standards.

Handbook 44 “The one book you can not do without”

This is the principle source for the details of the Sealing job. It would be a good thing if
you get and keep a copy handy. It is published annually by NIST. It is automatically sent to
NCWM members and usually arrives in the fall of the year. It is the definitive reference book
and you will use it a lot. All of the Specifications, Tolerances and other Technical
requirements for Weighing and Measuring devices will be found in it. If you can master all of
the parts of HB-44 that apply to your work you have accomplished a major achievement.

There is pending legislation to have each current edition of HB 44 automatically accepted
by the Commonwealth.

Handbook 133 _—— . a

Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods is the title. The current version is the
4th edition.

Handbook 112 Examination Procedures Outline (EPO)

This is a collection under one cover of all of the EPO information you
are likely to need. The most recent edition is dated 2002. There is an EPO for most
devices you will encounter. They lead you step by step through the examination and testing
of the device. They are organized for the Safety, Inspection, Pretest Determinations and a
Notes section. Each item refers you to a specific paragraph in HB-44

RICE-LAKE

Rice Lake Weighing Systems, 230 West Coleman Street, Rice Lake, Wisconsin
54868. Tele: 1-800-357-8627. They make about any kind of weight you could ever need.
Remember when talking to them that you need field standard equipment NOT laboratory
grade, you probably need avoirdupois weights as opposed to metric and the so-called 30-
pound test kit would work fine. Please get more specific information from the Division of
Standards. This is also a source for your very small weight kits for below 8 ounces and for
pharmacy and jewelry scales.

SERAPHIN

The five-gallon test measure you will use for testing liquid measuring devices is a Field Test
Standard. It is commonly called a volumetric prover . It is most commonly painted red but
some old green ones survive. Stainless steel seems to be the preferred choice for new ones. In
daily use everyone just calls it a prover.

The principal, but not the only, source of the five-gallon field test standard is Seraphin
Test Measure Co:, 30 Indel Ave, Rancocas, New Jersey 08073. Tele: (609) 267-0922 or by
Fax at (609) 261-2546. For sales try 1-800-573-6322 or Fax 1-800-373-6322. The stainless
steel field measure is probably your best bet. There are non-stainless test measures usually
with a painted finish for less money. There is also a plastic carry case available, which
greatly facilitates carrying, and storage. Before you place that new or any other field test
standard into service you should submit it to the state metrologist for calibration.

This is the same company that can provide a 5-gallon capacity funnel with a built in anti-
swirl tab. They are well made. They also have a new highboy version, which is easier on the
back. These funnels often have a copper nozzle to facilitate the electrical grounding when the
product is returned to the storage tanks.

Seraphin also makes the popular two-wheeled cart that helps moving that gasoline around
the station. That cart goes a long way toward saving your back and allowing relatively safe
transportation of fuel across busy areas.

They can also provide the environmental cap to fit over the opening of your field
standard that engages the rubber boot on a stage II nozzle. This is a must have item. It must
be electrically conductive so resist the idea of making your own out of PVC. You can also
purchase one locally from Wells Machine Shop, Tel# 781-424-4445 or e-mail:

Plainview, New York 11803. Tele: 1-800-342-0333, Fax 1-516-349-8389. They produce the
standard lead and wire seals and also the 5 inch Bulldog Press, which is the most popular
size. They also produce an 8-% inch press for those jobs where you just gotta have more
squeeze power. They also make the dies for the years and your jurisdiction that will fit both
presses. I have found it is best to order dies for several years at a time to save shipping. Be
prepared to give them the correct two or three letter identifier for your jurisdiction. A list of
these codes is appended. Any questions about the two or three letters can be resolved at the
Division of Standards. This year the dies for each year cost $9:60 each, plus shipping.

Badges

You are a Law Enforcement Officer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You are
entitled to carry and display as you see fit, an appropriate badge identifying you as a Sealer
and the jurisdiction you serve. The need for such display varies from Town to City I can only
say that in my case my badge never left the box it came in or the file it was thrown into six
years ago. Be careful with that symbol of authority. Hobbs and Warren can also supply the
badges.

SAFETY CONES

Those orange safety or the new safety green cones can save you much trouble. You
should have about /2 dozen and they should be the largest size you can get your hands on.
Use them at the point where you leave your funnel and both behind you and in front of you
while testing a dispenser. The horror stories about drivers at gas stations you will hear will
suffice until you get your own tales to tell. It seems the funnel attracts drivers that just need
to hit something. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES USE A CONE AS A FUNNEL. You are

SEALS:

The vinyl seal seems to be the most popular since it solves many of the minor
problems associated with the former round paper seal, which are still valid. Vinyl seals can
be purchased from Springfield label and Tape Co. 430 St. James Ave, Springfield, MA
01109-3896. Tele: 1-413-733-6634, Fax 1-413-731-5904. At meetings of the Sealers you can
often combine your order with another jurisdiction and achieve an economy of scale. There
are other sources for seals.

There are basically only four types of seals in use here today. They are:
a. SEAL of APPROVAL, Visible paper or vinyl seal

This seal is to show the public that you are doing your job and that the device has
been inspected, tested and approved by competent authority as determined by your
jurisdiction. This used to be exclusively a round paper seal which varied in color in odd /
even years. It identified the jurisdiction, the date and the Sealer. This type of paper seal is
still in use in some places. It has an advantage of being very inexpensive. They do not
hold up well when exposed to weather or repeated cleaning. The viny] seal will need to
have hole punched to indicate the month and date of issue. The vinyl seal will not fall off
due to weather if it was placed on a clean smooth surface. The viny] seal is not and
should not be used as a pressure sensitive seal when one is called for to secure the
adjustment access hole for scale calibration adjustment.

Note: The color of the seal has meaning. For odd years the color is red and for even
years use the green ones. Any printer in the state that usually prints these should know ‘
that. The color change is a fast way to identify which devices have been tested recently.
There are very specific language requirements for that printed viny] seal.

b. PRESSURE SENSITIVE SEAL, (PS)

These are new to the metrology world though they have been used in industry for
many years. They are a multiple layered very fine film that will not tolerate any
tampering with. If a PS seal has been tampered with then the underlying film will say
very clearly VOID or other words to indicate that all is not well. They break very easily
and resist alteration. Get used to them because more and more devices can only be sealed
by this method. Meaning that there are no provisions for a physical lead/wire seal. Again
the C.0.C will lead you to an answer. The newer HOBART deli scales are going this way
as are others.

c. SECURITY SEAL

This is the seal in Sealing. This is what locks in the data and prevents meddling. This is what
you are paid to employ. The vinyl seal is a feel good device but ultimately not as critical as
the security seal. Traditionally this has been a lead and wire combination seal. This seal to
assure integrity must have the wire doubled back through the lead lozenge before being
compressed with your mark. This seal assures that at the time you sealed the device it was
compliant with existing standards. The location of the sealing points is found on the C.0.C.

«fF


=== Image (20).jpg ===

That location is predicated on preventing any tampering with or alteration to the adjustment
mechanism. When you are done that device should have a lead seal that indicates your
jurisdiction and the year sealed. If you test a properly sealed device and it meets the standards
there is no need to replace the lead seal if it is not visible to the consumer,i.e. under a scale
platform or inside a motor fuel dispenser. It is there to tell you that no one has been
tampering. It also provides information as to the last time the seal was broken for adjustment.
If, in the course of your duties, you find that your dated security seal is in place and still
intact there is no reason to change it. Unless, of course, you need to make an adjustment to
the device.

There is an increased sensitivity to using lead in the environment so you might start to see
any of several plastic seal devices. These work fine if they perform the function of the
lead/wire seal. Tie wraps are not adequate and cannot be utilized

Many sealers now collect the old wire seals and dispose of them responsibly. The lead
lozenge is the issue. How green are you?

d. OTHER SEALS

The round aluminum or zinc seals are used on oil trucks and related meters as
well as taximeters. They make it easy to identify the month and year of the
sealing. This is useful on a cold day, they standout.

Placed under this category are also all the seals that you did not dispense. If they
were issued in compliance with the law the seal is valid. Often a device will be moved
from another jurisdiction and will come with the proper seal on it. I have encountered
seals from other states. Oil trucks cross jurisdiction lines many times a day. Sometimes a
deli scale will be relocated. If the seals are current and you have no reason to believe
there is a problem then relax.

When a service technician breaks your seal to make some kind of adjustment he/she
will then, usually, install one of his own. That seal does only one thing. It assures you that the
tech determined all was o.k. at the time he sealed it. That seal DOES NOT constitute a legal
seal for the purposes of complying with state law. The device is ina NOT SEALED
condition for which there is a legal issue and you are required to retest the device AND reseal
with your seal. The technician’s seal serves ONLY to preserve his settings in the device until
you come to test and seal the device.

New devices often come from the factory with a manufacturer seal certifying that the
device met their standards. That is good but not sufficient. Often you will see references to
ISO 9000, which is an international standard for quality control. You are to inspect and test
the device and place your seal on the device thus allowing it to be used in your jurisdiction.

That Cabinet

In the early 1900’s every city and town received a set of standard weights and
measures and a large equal arm balance, which was in a cabinet. The cabinet was custom
made. These cabinets and their balance and standards were and are the property of the

-18-


=== Image (21).jpg ===

Commonwealth. The local Sealers are now considered to be the custodian of the cabinets and
the contents. You are expected to inventory the contents and report annually to the Division
of Standards. This reporting is a part of your regular annual report. It is your responsibility to
insure the proper precautions to preserve the state standards are taken. In some communities
the cabinets and contents have become the ward of a historical commission or other
municipal body. The community must obtain permission from the Division of Standards if
control or custody is to be exercised by other than the local sealer. In the event a community
no longer wishes to adequately store and safeguard the cabinet and contents contact the
Division and make arrangements to return the property to the state.

When delivered the cabinet had glass doors on the upper portion and solid doors
below. The balance was the centerpiece. It operated by a lever, which lifted the device off the
resting points. The weights were stored to either side and went all the way up to 50 pounds.
There were also stored on the upper half a series of liquid measures from 1% gill up to the
traditional quart. In the lower cabinet are the cast iron measure devices for dry measures and
aiso a set of round wooden measures used to verify berry boxés and such. There was also a
cast iron fork (fairly large) in a wishbone shape. That fork slid into the triangular opening on
the lower left side of the cabinet to hold the measures and to allow you to empty them when
finished. The collection was rounded out with slicker plates and a yardstick. It was a
comprehensive work cabinet that served for many years. The Annual Report inventory sheet
lists the original contents of the cabinet.

In some jurisdictions the cabinet is maintained in such shape and with such care that
the field standards can be tested in the office. This can be very helpful in some cases. It has
been my experience that when you can find the cabinet no one seems to know why they have
it or who it belongs to. It is yours, protect it.

If you have a current set of state standards that have been certified by the state
metrology lab and are carefully maintained you may, after properly testing the scale balance,
use the state standards to certify your field standard weights. There is a requirement that you
maintain complete records of the balance testing and the testing of the field standards. It is
easier to take your filed standards to the state lab.

Car / Truck ?

) There are many different ways of arranging to move you and your equipment around
your jurisdiction. It is a matter worked out as part of the compensation or work conditions.

The generally accepted standard mileage fee for Massachusetts, in the private sector
this year (2004) is 38 cents per mile. That is the figure the IRS accepts. This might be one

approach to using your car or truck. Another approach, used in a few Towns, is a flat monthly
rate. Whatever works. ;

The healthiest and safest way to move this equipment around is in a pickup truck with
acap. You do not need to be sharing space with known carcinogens from the gasoline, diesel
or other petroleum based product you have run through your provers. A separate vented
compartment will resolve that issue. A van merely confines the odor and concentrates it
somewhat especially on a hot day. It can get real unpleasant driving with that odor.

I cannot overemphasize the nastiness and dangerousness of those fumes. They are
publicly identified as hazardous to your health

The large number of weights you will need on a random basis is a good argument for
permanently storing those weights in the back of a truck. Remember to insure they are
securely fastened to the floor at all times when traveling. One can get a very nasty headache
from flying 20# weights in a minor fender bender. Try to imagine a whole collection of 50#
weights doing their thing in a serious accident Basic safety requires the weights be secured at
all times.

Equip your vehicle with both a First Aid Kit and an appropriate fire extinguisher.

Common sense would urge that ALL of the provers and other hard objects be
adequately secured as well

In some jurisdictions the truck is used as a rolling toolbox and storage shed.
Everything the Sealer needs to store has a place in the truck.

Hand Tools

A small kit of hand tools will be needed. A level is required, though rarely used, to level
the test standard, also a razor scraper, a pair of wire cutters, pliers (needle nose are best) but
have both, WD-40, Q-Tips, rags, screwdriver, a dental type mirror,and spare keys for the fuel
dispensers. Plastic/rubber gloves are used by many, Flashlight and clipboard are also useful.
A bucket is essential to catch the drips from the gas nozzles. Paper towels, hand cleaner and
coveralls should be considered . Steel toed shoes or at least a gasoline resistant soled work
shoe can save you some pain. Fuel absorbent pads to catch that inevitable mess you will
make once in a while will save some embarrassment. A large screwdriver or small pry bar is
sometimes needed to open the caps on the underground tanks. They can be tough to do with
Just your fingertips - or as one Sealer was heard to remark “what! And break my nails”.

The hand press should have the correct jurisdiction and current year die installed.

) KEYS

All of the cabinets for fuel will be accessed by keys. The keys are generic within a
brand. A Gilbarco key will open all Gilbarco cabinets and the same holds true for the other
brands. Often keys can be obtained from the people that install or service the units. There will
often be a different key for the top section, which allows access to the keypad to get totalizer
information.

SAFETY VEST It is you on the line here. Safety vests at least improve the odds of
not being hit. Conventional wisdom has it that anything you have at a gas station is a target
and has been hit. Provers and funnels seem to be the most popular targets. Make yourself an
unlikely target and wear a safety vest.

That which is tested / inspected / sealed / condemned
Public Notice

In the early years owners of devices would be required to bring their equipment to

you for inspection and testing. This was done using the contents of “That Cabinet” I
mentioned earlier. The world has changed, Many devices are not transportable and now
you go to them. The laws change slowly and one vestige of the old way is the Public
Notice.

In order for you to have the ability to claim to have a compliant Sealing program
you must give the citizens due notice. That takes the form of the “Public Notice”
appended. This form, when properly displayed, serve to give the owner of devices legal
warning of the requirement for Sealing. The form, when filled out, must be posted in at
least two public places for at least two weeks. Public T.V. is not an acceptable choice but
it may supplement the chosen places. When you remove the signs file them as evidence
of compliance.

Seal What ?

In accordance with the law in this state any citizen may request you to check ANY
device at any time to determine iis accuracy and mark it according to your findings. A scale,
clearly marked NOT FOR USE IN RETAIL TRADE, can be checked and marked if the use
of the scale is non-commercial.

Seal to What Settings ?

When a device is calibrated it is to be set as close to zero as can be reasonably
achieved. In no circumstance can the device owner claim to “own” the right to have his
device off by a certain amount but within tolerance. The allowable tolerances are a
recognition that moving parts can and do wear. In the process of wearing the accuracy slips.
These tolerances are in place to allow you the Sealer some discretion before acting on the
amount of error. Tolerances are the acceptable limit of inaccuracy.

Sloppy Work!

On several occasions recently large stores have been found with missing tabs on the
scales for installing the sealing wires. It was not readily apparent that the devices were
missing required parts but a review of the CoC. revealed that the parts were indeed missing.
In one case 12 of 13 scales in one store were missing the sealing posts and could not be
sealed. It was eventually determined that the scale service company evidently did not
appreciate why the posts were there and just did not bother to reinstall them. In one
community the security seals were missing for several years and no one noticed.

Basic devices everyone deals with

WEIGHTS

The most common weight package is a kit normally referred to as a 30-pound kit. The
contents differ somewhat between suppliers but contain all you need to test the most common
scales in retail trade.

. . Keep.an eye.on where you placethe 30# weight kit or any other weights while
performing tests. They seem to like to dive into lobster tanks.

Vendor’s catalogs have assorted kits and a seemingly endless list of choices with the
weights. Talk with other Sealers at meetings to find out which kits might address your needs.
Donny Smith can assist any community with cogent advice. There is no one size fits all
answer since there are many different devices out there.

SCALES, LIGHT as opposed to heavy. Up to 100-pound capacity

The procedures for inspecting and testing are laid out in the EPOs and will take you
through it step by step. Be aware that almost all digital scales will have a CoC and that a
surprising number of scales that would appear to be pre-NTEP also have a CoC. The CoC
will alert you to what the configuration of the scale should be. For example in a fish market
(wet environment) you would not be surprised to see, indeed you must, a tray that drains the
water away from the product on the scale. It happens that not every scale is approved for a
fish tray even though it seems to belong there. The manufacturer chose not to submit the
scale for testing with that tray and the fish market cannot make the substitution. That was
their choice. There is a brand new 50 # digital computing scale that has a CoC et al. In the
shipping box the manufacturer includes a tare basket, which mounts on the receiver of the
scale. If you consult the CoC you find that it is not approved for retail trade with that tare
basket mounted or used. The scale is approved only with a flat platform receiver. Only prior
consultation with the CoC will reveal these problems. That brand new Class 3, NTEP
approved scale could not be sealed in the as found condition. It did look good though.

Some scale makers seem to play hide the sealing posts. These are the bolts that have a
small hole drilled through the top from side to side. The mere presence of this post does not
mean that it is the place for the seal. I have noticed that these posts turn up in the oddest
places. They are not always obvious as to their location or type of seal. The CoC will
forewarn you. Some scales require two security seals. There is a new deli scale out that
requires you to get assistance to turn it upside down to seal it. You might not know that if you
did not have the CoC. When asked for a recommendation for a replacement scale you are
wise to refer the buyer to the yellow pages for reference. This will eliminate any conflict of

-22-


=== Image (25).jpg ===

23

interest and reduce backlash if the buyer is unhappy with any thing. It would be appropriate
to explain the need for a ‘legal for trade” Class III NTEP certified scale. Adjusting electronic
scales is beyond your pay grade. It is best if you do not attempt any adjustments. There are
plenty of service technicians out there to make whatever corrections that are needed.

MEDICAL / ATHLETIC SCALES

These scales are NOT a part of the retail trade under which our sealing is done. There
is no requirement that you get involved. Having said that I want to remind you that members
of your local high school wrestling team and or the local football team need to be weighed
prior to competition. Many Sealers perform this service at no cost. These scales do not have
provisions for sealing the adjustment parts so there is no assurance the scales are accurate the
day after you leave. People tend not to tamper.

The Medical scales like those found in Doctors offices are usually the human weighers
running up to around 500# max. They are not Class Ili nor do they have to be. If you are
going to test these you will be hauling a lot of cast iron around with you. This would be a
good area to get clear about with your boss as to the policy about Medical scales. Put a vinyl
seal on it if that is what they need.

HANGING SCALES

Those usually round-faced chain suspended scales that lurk around the produce
department are not required to be certified by weights and measures as they are not used in
direct sales. However they usually are NIEP compliant and have a CoC issued. They are
used in retail trade because people make buying and cost estimates based on the readings.
The produce gets weighed again at check out. Thus, common practice is to seal the hanging
scales, and that choice is up to the retailer. Regardless of what you do they must hang clear of
obstructions.

JEWELRY SCALES

They are a separate certification and are the concern of the local sealer. Retail
precious metals and semi precious gem weighing could be Class III or Class Il. If a scale is
Class II device you must have the correct weights to test. Most are Class III

PHARMACY SCALES

They are a separate certification and are the concern of the local sealer. The weights
used by a pharmacist are also tested. Since you cannot seal a weight there is a special
certificate you will issue upon completion. This certificate is a part of the requirements the
MA Pharmacy Board looks for during their inspection. It is a small blessing if you will do the
pharmacy scales and weights each year about the same time. It saves getting wires crossed
with the Pharmacy Board.

There is a movement toward electronic/digital scales , which are certified to class II
standards. To test these device you would need a weight set certified to class II metrics.

FARM STANDS,

These are usually seasonal operations but an enormous value of product crosses the
counter. It is only fair that accurate devices are employed. These usually are the round
hanging style but more digital devices are turning up.

UPS / SHIPPING SCALES

Contrary to what is sometimes argued, those UPS scales out there are subject to state
law and need to be sealed. It has been settled. Any questions call Division of Standards.
Some of them are dual capacity devices that can go from 1-30 pounds and then from 0-300
pounds. Both modes must be tested. Obviously this applies to all UPS/FEDEX/DHL and any
other shipping scale regardless of who owns it. ;

Scales, in excess of 100 pound capacity

In this category are a lot of retail scales from around 100# capacity up to the 1200#
Fairbanks style platform scale. All of the rules that apply to the light scales apply here. In
addition you will need a set of weights, usually the grip variety, to get'the scale load up to the
required levels. The amount of test weight you must have to do the testing correctly is
specified in HB-44. This type of scale is often found around fish markets. Many of the older
steelyard type platform scales have been upgraded with the use of digital components. These
upgrades have been performed by the manufacturer and have a CoC issued approving the
upgrade. Some scales have been upgraded locally by using digital components, which are
individually approved. These scales are to be tested in accordance with HB-44 and not just
tested in the range they are usually used for.

Notes:
Do not assume the scale guy knows the codes or state laws. It is not required of him.

Silver is the color code for our familiar avoirdupois sets of weights. If you run into
metric,scales you must use the appropriate gold colored weights.

With the exception of the pharmacy balance or scales or the pre-pack scales the
consumer must be able to see the operation of all scales.

Generally all scale operations against a back wall will not be compliant.

Some perfectly “legal for trade” scales come with trays, which, if installed, render the
device “not legal for trade”. That is why the Certificate of Conformance is so important.

HEAVY TRUCK SCALES

These are found in construction yards, junkyards, cement plants and many
cities and towns have them at the landfill / transfer station. The heavy scales owned by the
town are sometimes involved in retail trade. At the very least the community has a contract
with an agency to remove the waste for a fee. There are some specifics that apply only to the
heavy scales that are worth noting. Generally the big scales are not approved to weigh loads
that do not challenge the system. Loads of fewer than 1000#s may be too light for accurate
measurement. For many of the heavy scales loads below specified limits are prohibited due to
the inability of the scale to discern the values. There is a difference in minimum load between
scrap material for recycling and all other materials. The scale code part of HB 44 will show
you the values for these lower limits.

In most jurisdictions a scale company wili perform the testing as they have the equipment
needed. The local sealer will monitor the test and place his security and viny] seal in the
appropriate places. The role of the local sealer is to insure that the scales have been found in
compliance with existing standards across the full spectrum of weight the scale is capable of
handling. Beware the tendency to only test to the “usual load”.

Given that these scales need enormous amounts of weight it should be obvious that you
do not have to haul it. Usually a scale company has a maintenance contract to service the
device. They will have weights that are traceable. You should verify this. When they conduct

" the test you watch, ask questions, verify the testing then you and only you can put the local
Jurisdictions seal on the device. If you have never seen one done you should know that the
truck that comes for the test as well as the weights it carries is a part of the test. It does not
really matter what the truck weighs. The truck will not be a certified weight as we know them
but it will be a part of the strain load placed on the scale. If there is a spare forklift or front-
end loader around they might use it for the strain load portion of the testing. Do not overlook
the bulldozer parked nearby. Almost any thing is useful if it is very heavy.

These scales require a separate certification.

Virtually all the rules for testing the local deli scales apply to the heavy truck scales. It is
justa matter of scale, I could not resist that. There are of course some very specific
requirements in HB-44. These do NOT apply to scales used in law enforcement and we do
not seal law enforcement scales. No split drafts or axle scales are allowed.

Notes:

56,000 Pounds, the usual weight of a scale testing truck is just not enough. Do not fall
for the argument that that is all the weight is available.

PRE-PACK SCALES,

In The Commonwealth of Massachusetts we consider this a commercial device,
which must be tested and sealed. These are often found in the back room of the meat
department at the local supermarket. These scales will not often be visible to a consumer and
they do not need to be. A consumer can have a prepacked package reweighed in front of
him/her.

RAILWAY SCALES

We have only a few of these in the state. They are a separate certification and are the
concern of the local sealer. Minimum test load is 80,000 pounds and a certified railroad test
car is required for these.

BELT CONVEYOR SCALES,

These devices are also required to comply with NIST etc. They are used for weighing
product as it moves down a conveyor belt. The calculations are based on the amount of
electric load is involved to move the product over a short (4 to 10 feet long) distance. They
are used primarily for weighing product of a uniform size / shape. They are used to weigh
moving coal (screened to a uniform size) grain and other bulk products of a similar nature. In
approved installations they achieve an accuracy of +/- 5# per ton. An issue came up when a
company used a portable belt conveyor scale to bid with a local Department of Public Works
to process removed road asphalt and associated dirt and gravel for a fixed price per ton. The
grinding process involved produces a product called “reclamate”. It is recycled roadway and
is used by the DPW for roadwork. I understand the companies are still moving around the
state selling their service. Keep your eyes open. This device was not approved. If you
encounter one call the Division of Standards.

MEASURES

MOTOR FUEL DEVICES

With the advent of electronics and the price of gasoline passing the dollar mark came
a revolution in the display and accounting for the amounts of money and product. Most of the
meters in the pumps out there are very much like what has been around a long time. What has
changed is the control of some of the meters. As technology advances look for meters that
self-test and self adjust. We are not quite there yet but subtle changes are showing up. You
can no longer assume that the meters are straightforward. Once again the C.o.C would be
very helpful here.
Always test the diesel fuel devices before the gas devices to avoid the chance of a
static spark discharge when filling your prover or using the funnel. There have been instances
where the 5-gallon Test Measure has burst into flames.

The Totalizer on each device is to be in good working order even if the management does
not use it. We use it to validate flows and in checking blends. Electronic or mechanical is
acceptable. It is required to be functioning. We need the information it provides for our
reporting.

Blend pumps are tested by a different process than the single product devices. Both types
are tested using the Examination Procedure Outline (EPO ) as appropriate. NIST publishes
these EPOs to assist in the orderly inspection of all of the devices covered by NIST. The two
you need are the Single Product Retail Motor Fuel Dispensers (EPO # 21) and the blended
product (EPO # 22). Blend product is returned to the tanks at the lowest octane grade of fuel
regardless of which blend you tested.

AIRPORTS

Some of you will have airports to serve. They are much like a service station
in thatthey have meters. Be real careful about the octane rating of the tested product since the
range of octanes can be very large. Jet fuel is a form of kerosene and thus presents no unique
safety hazards. The testing of airports with in ground hydrants is specialized and the typical
Sealer will not encounter them. The danger of fuel contamination requires that the Sealer be
very careful in the handling of the product. There are special considerations to bear in mind
about disposing of the product you have tested. Often the fuel cannot be put back in the
ground. The airport personnel will work with you.

MARINAS

Including some yacht club facilities. In addition to normal dispensers in the
boatyard, Marinas often have dispensers down on the floats. It can be a long haul to

-27-

return the product to the tanks. It is always smart to consider the time of high tide as it
can shorten the height you have to climb with the provers. This is one of the places where
only the five-gallon test measure will work. The truck or trailer will not work because it
cannot get there. There are specific user requirements in HB-44 for airports and marinas.

TIRED?

The field test standard (prover) be it stainless steel or painted steel weighs about 15
pounds empty. Diesel fuel has a specific gravity of .84 and a full prover weighs 49.99#.
Gasoline has a specific gravity of .74 and a full prover weighs 45.8#. Kerosene has a specific
gravity of .80 so a full prover weighs 48.33#. Water has a specific gravity of 1.0 so you can
understand why these fuels float on top of water.

In a modest sized station with nine dispensers totaling 36 meters and 18 blends of
gasoline you will have moved 90 test drafts (individual full provers) from the dispenser to the
in-ground tank, that comes out to carrying 4,124 # to the in-ground tank, lifting it to pour into
the funnel and another 1,350 # just hauling the empty cans back for the next load. Do you
still wonder why you are tired?

SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY

This cannot be emphasized enough. There are a number of components to an
effective safety program but none will be as portable and effective as that device between
your ears. Common sense will usually alert you to a problem. Do not ignore it when you get
the feeling something is wrong.

The National Conference on Weights and Measures Task Force on Safety issued a
Final Report in July 1991. It is available online for members at the NCWM website. That
report lead to the changing of the EPO,s to include specific Safety guidance in each EPO.
The basic report is 45 pages.

Typical of the unexpected danger areas would be the proper grounding of a scale ina
wet environment. An incorrect wiring job could be found to absolutely shocking when you
try to install a wire seal.

One danger is static electricity. Do not wear nylon clothing when testing gasoline.
Always touch the nozzle to the side of the prover while filling and make sure the prover is
grounded. If you use any kind of cart to hold or transport the provers insure proper
grounding. When returning product to the ground use a metal funnel and touch the prover to
it to insure a good ground.

This is probably not a good time to use your cell phone.
Always test the diesel first. Just a reminder about the dangers of static electricity and fire.

The static electrical charge is generated by the differences in the friction if diesel is poured
over a gasoline-covered surface.

Use the orange highway cones to protect yourself and your equipment but ALWAYS
expect someone will drive right over them, I use my truck to block the area in which I am
working.

Open the dispenser, the skirts at the base of the dispenser, to ventilate the meter area
before inspecting it. Look for any signs of leaks. Do not touch that problem. If you find a
very minor one your job is done for the day with that unit. Shut it down, inform the owner
and require that the matter be addressed before you test the device. The device may not be
used by anybody until the problem is fixed. If you find a significant leak---call the Fire
Department. Use some common sense here and point out the issues to the owner.

The wiring inside the skirts must all be in the conduits it was originally in. Conduits that
are no longer threaded together or are missing sections are not acceptable. Intrinsically safe
wiring is allowed. You will spot a patch job or jury rig.

Always touch the nozzle to the prover when testing the meter to avoid the buildup of
static electricity.

Always touch the 5-gallon Test Measure to the funnel as you pour. The funnel will be -
grounded thus your can is grounded.

In asking for better equipment you can point out the implications for the community if
you were to trip and let go of one or more of those provers while enroute to the funnel. After
all you are moving 2 tons to the funnel, and this is for a modest size station. One spark or hot
catalytic converter could ignite the gasoline and ruin your whole day

Notes:

Please see my earlier comments on wearing a high visibility vest.
Every cubic “inch” on a prover translates to about $60/year per meter.

Hand written receipts for fuel is O.K. if they are legible.

If you see a hose resting on top of a cabinet, (not properly hung up) be cautious about
buying gas from that station.

When checking a NEW station you will be shutting off all electric power for 15

minutes to verify that the meters can remember the displayed values that you had previously
recorded.

Gilbarco Meters; the totalizers only have 5 digits displayed. You will have to get the
full totalizer numbers from the console.

A broken or missing lock on a cabinet (the skirts) of a dispenser is “not as designed”
so it can be cited. These enclosures have a certificate of conformance. Usually just have the
owner get them fixed.

Do not be surprised to find all the meters inside the same cabinet with the same serial
number.

Never notify a station in advance of your coming. Out of a sense of fairness try to do the
testing during non-peak hours.

How many vinyl stickers you should place on a dispenser is up to you, but at least one
must be visible on each side the public uses.

You must record the serial numbers of the meters so you can prove it is/is not the same
pump you saw last time.

Some identifying information can be hard to find, painted over, under or behind
something. Painted over data plates and or identification is in a form that renders any
information no longer readable. The CoC requires the information be readable.

One additional reason we do the slow test is because some new cars will not accept fuel
at the full flow the nozzle is capable of.

On a prover the little curve on the liquid level is called a meniscus. A reading is taken
across the bottom edge.

The audit trail is an emerging concept as the principal way to learn what has happened.
New meters can and indeed do fail acceptance tests.

Spring water would be tested in the 5-gallon prover. The Spring water dispensers are our
concern — they are uncomplicated — usually a timer on a pipe, they are rarely a problem.

The prover must be “wet” prior to testing to get it into an “as delivered “condition, which
is what the prover is for.

The Wayne / Dresser Vista Series meters are essentially self adjusting and you have to
alter you usual patterns in adjusting these.

About the benzene and other chemicals in and around service stations, there is an
unproven theory that the fumes lead to hair loss in men.

Gilbarco Meters need a “long” Q-tip to clean off the totalizer for you to read it. They are
deeply recessed in the side of the dispenser.

It is legal to advertise and sell in metric units in Massachusetts.

Some diesel meters have hi-flow nozzle for trucks and a low -flow for cars. The
difference in size is apparent. The truck nozzle is of high capacity to expedite fueling in very
large quantities. That nozzle would not fit in an automobile fuel tank. You cannot legally test
a high capacity nozzle with a five-gallon prover.

OCTANE TESTING

Despite what you might conclude we, at our level, do not usually get involved with
Octane testing. Some jurisdictions, usually cities or County level organizations are
conducting such testing. This testing calls for specialized equipment not usually available to a
small Town Sealer.

CNG---- also known as COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS

This is one of several alternative fuels being developed for vehicles. The dispensers
and associated equipment are NTEP approved and in use today in the state. The testing
procedure involves scales not your trusty gas prover. The measuring is done using Mass
Flow Meters and a lot of electronic control and calculations. With operating pressures in the
4000 io 5006 psig range the servicing is specialized. The local sealer must seal the device if it
is used in direct sales to consumers. The CoC specifies the location of the security seal.

These devices are currently used for vehicle fleets and are only in service in six places I
know of; Boston, Waltham, Lowell, Yarmouth, Wakefield and Springfield. If you have
questions about these installations call one of the Sealers.

Notes:

. CNG is methane based (90% min) and all calculations are temperature
adjusted to 70 degrees Fahrenheit

CNG is very temperature sensitive. CNG is 130 Octane

CARBON DIOXIDE

Liquid Measuring Devices: This is the new kid on the block. Liquid carbon dioxide
is used for fire extinguishers and most commonly, it seems, to provide the push for all
those soft drink dispensers in the Wendy’s, Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut and all
those thousands of places that do not serve from bottles. There are many other uses in the
Commonwealth. The liquid is transported and sold much the way home heating oil is
with some very significant differences. It is very cold and has its own set of handling
requirements. It is sold by weight, which is determined by meters. Those meters need
sealing and the associated printer needs inspection. Section 3.38 of HB-44 has the
pertinent information. These trucks range all over the state and you might keep an eye
open for them. It is a specialized inspection and testing procedure which will require
equipment the typical sealer will not have. For assistance contact the Div. Of Standards.

OTHER FUELS

PROPANE TANKS

The 20# BBQ style tank is the most common in the state. The law requires that the
propane be sold by weight or measure. Thus a tare must be taken and then a net weight of
propane to be pumped into the tank. They cannot be filled for a flat rate. There must be a
scale at the refill site and it must be used. Any talk you may hear about the “new” valves
changing things is just that. Nothing has changed. The new valves actually prevent filling the
tank and usually stop the flow at the 80% full mark. Thus it is impossible to get 20# of
propane in a 20# tank. See the two pages of propane testing appended.

PROPANE METERS

The Division has the responsibility for testing these devices. If you recall propane
must be sold by weight or measure. The meter is the measure component the state has a
specialized device for dealing with propane.

VEHICLE TANK METERS / OIL TRUCKS /
BULK RACK METERS

Some jurisdictions do not have the adequate equipment to perform the required
testing. In those cases the testing will have to be done by a qualified Sealer from another
jurisdiction, or the equipment can be rented at the expense of the business from Northeast
Petroleum Supply Company in Jamaica Plain, Boston. The Division does have some
equipment they will loan if you are certified and willing. The failure of a jurisdiction to
provide you with the required prover does not exempt the local dealer from the sealing
requirements under state law. These are separate certifications and are the concern of the
local sealer.

Notes:
The price per gallon must be on the ticket at the time of delivery

The entire VIM stack, the meter, preset and the printer must be sealed to be
considered legal.

The metal discs formerly used in sealing are generally considered obsolete.

Some new VTMs require a programmed laptop to calibrate. That laptop is not always
in the truck.

In examining the VTMs we should make every reasonable effort to keep that truck on
the road.

FIREWOOD

128 CUBIC FEET, the law is very clear. Firewood is less than 4 feet and more than 8
inches and it is split. In responding to a complaint you do not have to stack it, they do.

The quantity is determined when the wood is closely stacked.
If cordwood is advertised, that is what you bought. Cordwood is 4 feet long.

There must be a receipt for the delivery, see Chapter 94, Section 299

REVERSE VENDING MACHINES

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has certified them as retail trade devices, thus
we seal them. If they work seal them with a vinyl seal. I watch them at the stores while doing
other duties. If they do what they are supposed to do seal them. They are required to have a
notice on them about how to deal with a problem.

Devices beyond basic certification
These devices require a separate qualification from the Division of Standards in order for
you to inspect test and seal. The local sealer will encounter devices he/she are not familiar

with and are not qualified to seal. Do not be afraid to contact the Division of Standards for
help. It is understood that you might not be qualified to seal these devices. The state can help.

TAXI METERS

The meters in taxis need sealing. They are a separate certification and are the
concern of the local Sealer.

COIN OPERATED AMUSEMENT DEVICES

Not a certification and not a local Sealer issue, yet. Only check based on a complaint.
Contact the service area representative and check unit with him.

LOAD CELLS

We do not test individual load cells but in almost every digital scale we examine we
are dealing with one or more load cells. The typical retail scale will have from 1 to 4 load
cells. They work on the electrical theory of changes of conductivity in a very fine wire when
that wire is placed under stress, i.e. load. They are very reliable and well protected from
abuse. The voltages and amperages are very very low. There is no electrical hazard from
them. I do not know why you would be touching one. All load cells are required to have a
CoC. Load cells must be installed plumb, not torqued or tilted.

Additional Disciplines: none of these have associated fee schedules in the law.

These are compliance issues.
The following activities require specific certification:

UNIT PRICING, conducted pursuant to M.G.L. ch 6, -115A

ITEM PRICING, conducted pursuant to M.G.L. ch 94, - 184C-184D

PRICE VERIFICATION

The importance and necessity of price verification is apparent in everyday life to both
consumers as well as retailers. It is part of your responsibility as an inspector, as well as it
being the law, to conduct price verification inspections in retail locations that utilize any type
of scanning system, including price look up systems. The purpose of the procedure is to
ensure that consumers are being charged the correct price for the items they purchase.

» Publication 19 outlines the only appropriate method used for price verification
inspections. It clearly explains multiple sampling procedures and strongly emphasizes the
importance of random selection. Price verification classes have been offered by the Division
of Standards and continue to do so periodically. All weights and measures inspectors must
be certified in price verification order to conduct these inspections.

Some lessons of price verification can never be taught in a handbook. Common
sense, consideration and courtesy are just as important as the procedures reviewed in
Publication 19. A few things to consider when planning price verification inspections:

Avoid certain retailers during certain times of the year (i.e. the mall stores at
holiday time)

-34-


=== Image (37).jpg ===

35

Do not hold up normal business to conduct your inspections (i.e. if a register is
needed and you are testing it, step away until it is available)

Take the time to introduce yourself and explain the inspection and the procedure
to the merchant

The state requires an accuracy rate of 98% and there are fees for this inspection pass
or fail, based on the number of automated devices. Additional inspections (i.e. reinspections)
are $75 apiece. In addition to this fines of $100 each are issued for any overcharges, up to a
maximum of $2,500 per inspection.

Per the Consumer and Merchant’s Protection Act of 1998, “the director of his
inspectors, and sealers and inspectors of weights and measures....shall in every 24-month
period examine and test the operation of all automated retail checkout systems.” It has been
the policy of the Division of Standards to inspect retail locations every year and every other
for any store that has passed in the previous year.

Thanks to Kim Connors for the above information.
NOT YOU’RE BUSINESS, but keep your eyes open.

From time to time you may encounter some thing, which is not part of your job
description. What you do with that information is up to you.

In the performance of your work you will indeed find things, which are the
responsibility of the local FIRE DEPARTMENT. Pass the information on to them for action.
If you see an apparent violation of state law or a fire safety issue you are obliged to report it
to both the owner and competent authority.

The state Fire Prevention Regulations requires the presence of shear valves on motor fuel
dispensers. These valves will be the lowest valves on the fuel line supplying the dispenser.
They are installed in order to cut off the supply of fuel in the event of an accident. They
MUST be there for all devices and there is no grandfathering involved. If you do not have
them you have an unsafe situation. See 527 CMR 5.07 (9).

Safety barrier or guardrails at the ends of the pump islands must protect the dispenser, These
are sometimes called bollards. The dispensers must also be rigidly mounted on a concrete
platform at least 6 inches high.

The head of the local fire department must specifically approve in writing any dispensing

device within ten feet from the outside of a building.
Finally: If you have a problem do not hide it-get some help- the Division can respond
gently or severely as the situation may call for. Ask them.
