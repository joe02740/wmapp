            <div className="ai-example">
              <strong>W&M Helper:</strong> "Under Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 98, ¬ß¬ß56-57, you can issue fines of $200 per violation. For 12 items, that's $2,400 total.

              <strong>W&M Helper:</strong> "Under the recent Mass Means Business initiative, electronic price tags are permitted with restrictions: price updates only during store closure hours OR between 1:00-3:00 AM for 24-hour stores. This prevents the pricing manipulation issues you've encountered while allowing business flexibility."
